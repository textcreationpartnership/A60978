            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Author of this Piece (as I may ſay) was ſtopped in the very middle of his Courſe; he intended to have added a third Part to the two others which were publiſh'd, and in it to have examin'd what Divinity the Holy Scriptures attribute to Jeſus Chriſt. He would have confin'd himſelf to what the four Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts acquaint us concerning it, and made it appear to the meaneſt Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, that the Ideas thoſe Sacred Writers have given us, are very wide from ſuch as the Antients put upon 'em, and the Moderns have eſpouſed. But Death prevented the Execution of this Deſign, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Publick from reaping the Benefit of it. However if this Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay meet with the Approbation it merits, the World may be oblig'd with a <hi>Diſſertation</hi> the Author has left upon the <hi>Goſpel of St.</hi> John. It may be ſaid of this excellent Man, that he was a Perſon of very great Penetration as well as Piety, and that he made the Study of the Holy Scriptures his greateſt Entertainment. He had nothing in view but a Search after Truth, which when he had found, he embrac'd it with all his Heart; for he was incapable of betraying or diſguiſing it, for any ſecular Intereſt whatever. This plain dealing drew upon him many Enemies, but his Patience in a manner overcame all; and the firm hopes he had of a better Life after this did always ſupport him, under all the Tryals thro which the Calumnies and Malice of his Enemies had forc'd him. His Friends have this Comfort however, That thoſe very Perſecutors could not refuſe him when alive, nor ſince his Death, the Elogies that his Vertues <hi>drew</hi> from 'em; and, according to the Cuſtom of this preſent Age, they took care in his behalf, <hi>to diſtinguiſh the Morals from the Doctrine.</hi> The Publick will ſee by what is bere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to 'em, what Judgment ought to be made of the latter.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>GOD dwelling in an inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Light, where no one can either find or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, was yet willing to reveal himſelf to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, either by the way of a <hi>Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> without, or by the way of <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> within. To manifeſt himſelf, 1. He environs himſelf with a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Light, whence he cauſeth his Voice to be heard, and declares his Will. 'Tis thence that he ſpeaks to Angels: For being inviſible by his Nature, even in reference to Angels, it is neceſſary, that whenever he is pleas'd to declare his Orders to theſe <hi>Miniſtring Spirits,</hi> he ſhould give them ſome marks of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in ſome certain Place in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and make his Will known. This <hi>Manifeſtation</hi> is ſo lively and luminous, that the Eyes of Men cannot bear the Splendor of it in this mortal Life. None but the <hi>glorified Spirits</hi> may enjoy this Privilege in common with the Angels, and which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the <hi>ſeeing of God face to face.</hi> It is thus without doubt that Jeſus Chriſt beheld him. Mr. <hi>Le Clerc</hi> hath very well obſerv'd (on <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.18.) that <hi>Moſes,</hi> who had ſuch frequent Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Divine Favour, deſir'd this as a ſingular advantage, that God, who us'd to ſhew himſelf in a Cloud, would vouchſafe at laſt to diſcover to him his Glory in the ſame manner as he doth in Heaven. But this is too much for a Mortal; this <hi>Glorious</hi> Preſence is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage reſerv'd for the Angels, as I ſaid before. And without doubt it was in ſuch like Splendor that he preſented himſelf before them when he deſign'd to create the World, and pronounc'd theſe words, <hi>Let there be Light.</hi> At leaſt this is the Sentiment of <hi>Baſil</hi> of <hi>Seleucia,</hi> in his firſt Oration upon theſe words, <hi>In the beginning God created,</hi> &amp;c. God ſaid, <hi>Let there be Light.</hi> 
                     <q>The Voice was heard, and the World produc'd. But could not he have perform'd what he deſign'd in ſilence, and without ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering a word? Would not the Work have obey'd the leaſt token of his Will? Certainly the Heaven and the Earth, with the Waters, were already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd without any preceding Voice.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:200403:4"/>But it was not ſo with the Light, the Voice preceded the Production. What ſort of a Voice is this, and what was the cauſe of it? Let us learn to hearken to Scripture, even when it is ſilent, and inſtruct our ſelves when it ſpeaks. Behold here you have it. The infinite Companies of Angels that were created, ſaw indeed the things that were a doing, but could not perceive their Author, nor diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Cauſe (for the <hi>Divine Eſſence</hi> is really even above the Contemplation of Angels.) 'Tis not then without reaſon that God uſher'd in his Voice, to make himſelf ſenſible to thoſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial <hi>Spirits,</hi> and to ſtir up their admiration; that ſeeing the Effect fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd immediately the Word and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, they being aſtoniſh'd at the Prodigy, ſhould turn themſelves whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the knowledg of their Creator, and celebrate his Praiſes, ſaying, Is there any greater than this? God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf teacheth us this Truth in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with his Servant <hi>Job</hi> (<hi>Job</hi> 28.7. <hi>apud</hi> LXX.) <hi>When I made the Stars, all the Angels prais'd me with a loud Voice.</hi> For by reaſon of their aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proceeding from the Greatneſs of that Spectacle, they repeated their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, and redoubled their Applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes at every Work that God was a doing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. God makes uſe of the Perſon of an Angel, that bears his Name, and ſpeaks by his Authority. 'Tis thus that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd and ſpoke to the Patriarchs, and this is the reaſon why <hi>Philo</hi> calls <hi>Angels Words</hi> ſo often. The Author of <hi>Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Anſwers to the Orthodox</hi> ſpeaks thus of this <hi>Manifeſtation:</hi> 
                     <q>All the Angels, ſaith he, which appeared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Men, inſtead and in the Perſon of <hi>God,</hi> have born the Name of God. Men likewiſe have been call'd Gods.</q> Both theſe were honour'd with this Title by reaſon of their Commiſſion, which when at an end, they ceaſe to be call'd <hi>Gods. God</hi> himſelf ſays concerning the <hi>Angel</hi> that was to conduct the People of <hi>Iſrael, Obey him, for I have put my Name in him.</hi> He ſaith as much of Men, whom he inveſted with Magiſtracy: <hi>Ye are Gods, and Sons of the moſt High.</hi> He ſaith to them, <hi>Ye are Gods,</hi> viz. I have given you my Glory with my Name, and ſet you in my Place.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, God appears after a ſenſible manner in the ſanctified Fleſh of his Son, who is <hi>the Brightneſs of his Glory, his Image and Character;</hi> which is the <hi>great Myſtery of Godlineſs, God manifeſted in the Fleſh, and ſpeaking to us in theſe laſt Times by his own Son.</hi> For Jeſus Chriſt doth now ſucceed the Angels, and ſpeaks to us in the Perſon of <hi>God.</hi> The <hi>Angels</hi> are now become his <hi>Miniſtring Spirits,</hi> and our <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Servants. Gregory the Great</hi> teacheth us this (<hi>Homil.</hi> 8. <hi>in Evangel.</hi>) <q>The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, ſaith he, reconcile him with us; and they who deſpis'd us in our low Eſtate, look upon us now as their Companions. Hence it comes that <hi>Lot</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> have worſhipt <hi>Angels, Gen.</hi> 19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. without being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd for it. But St. <hi>John</hi> going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to worſhip an Angel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. the Angel repuls'd him, ſaying, <hi>Take heed thou doeſt it not, I am thy Fellow-Servant.</hi> Hence it is, that before the Redeemer's coming the Angels ſuffer'd themſelves to be worſhip'd by Men, without oppoſing it: but ſince they now refuſe their Adorations, is it not, that ſeeing our Nature rais'd above theirs, they can no longer ſuffer that it ſhould be ſubmitted to them, and diſdain not to look upon Man as their Companion, ever ſince they are oblig'd to worſhip a Man-God?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe <hi>Apparitions</hi> are call'd the <hi>Word of God,</hi> or, to ſpeak with the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> his <hi>Shechinah,</hi> that is, his <hi>Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> and his <hi>Preſence.</hi> But the laſt is the <hi>Word of God</hi> by way of Excellence; 1. Becauſe God reveals thereby his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> final and principal Deſign, his laſt and perfect Will. 2. Becauſe God appears here, not only in ſome meaſure, but with the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Graces. 3. Becauſe he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:200403:4"/>himſelf here not in a tranſitory man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but inſeparably, intimately and perpetually. Hence it is that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith only of J. C. <hi>that his Name is the Word of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>St. <hi>John</hi> deſcribes to us the firſt of theſe <hi>Manifeſtations,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>that the Word was in the beginning, that this Word was with God; and this Word by which all things were made, was God himſelf.</hi> In effect <hi>God</hi> himſelf was the <hi>Word,</hi> when he ſpake to create the World out of nothing, becauſe he ſpoke im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, without the intervention of any <hi>Angel,</hi> or the Miniſtry of any Man. The Doctrine of St. <hi>John</hi> is no other herein, than that of the other Sacred Writers. <hi>God ſaid,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.9. <hi>and all was made.</hi> And to explain what this Speech was, he adds, <hi>God commanded, and all was created.</hi> Where we ſee that his Word is nothing elſe but his <hi>immediate Command.</hi> Is there any other Myſtery in what St. <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth us, <hi>That the Heavens as well as the Earth were made by the Word of God?</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5. Was it not by his Power and Command? What doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> mean, when he aſſures us, <hi>That the World was made by the Word of God? Heb.</hi> 11.3. You cannot find here the Myſtery, for the <hi>myſterious</hi> Word is not in the Original (it is <gap reason="foreign">

He means therefore that the World was made by the ſingle Command of God, and not by the <hi>Logos</hi> of <hi>Plato.</hi> The ſame Evangeliſt St. <hi>John</hi> a little after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes to us the laſt of theſe <hi>Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> when he adds, that <hi>this Word was made Fleſh;</hi> that is to ſay, that the Fleſh of J. C. was a glorious Cloud, where God made himſelf viſible in theſe laſt Times, and made his Will known: ſo that the <hi>Word,</hi> or the <hi>Preſence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is now no longer a Body of <hi>Light,</hi> or the Perſon of an <hi>Angel,</hi> but truly a <hi>Man,</hi> a Body, and palpable Fleſh. <hi>Ireneus</hi> calls this Diſpenſation, <hi>the Oeconomy of God in the human Nature,</hi> lib. 1. c. 4. <hi>Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomew of Edeſſa</hi> conceived no otherwiſe of this <hi>Incarnation,</hi> when he expreſſeth himſelf thus in his Refutation of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met:</hi>

God dwelt in the <hi>Ark</hi> heretofore, and there ſhewed his <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and receiv'd there the Homage from his People; but now he dwells in the Fleſh of J. C. but with a greater Power, and in a more glorious and more viſible manner.</p>
                  <p>That St. <hi>John</hi> had no other thought, may be proved by ſome of our beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters: But in order to underſtand them better before we produce their Teſtimonies, we muſt ſay ſomething a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſecond <hi>Manifeſtation</hi> of God. <hi>viz.</hi> that by the Miniſtry of the Angels. The Old Teſtament calls theſe Heavenly Meſſengers often, the <hi>Face of God,</hi> his <hi>Glory,</hi> and his <hi>Preſence,</hi> which is the ſame thing with his <hi>Word.</hi> But beſides this, we will ſet down here thoſe remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Words of <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, lib.</hi> 1. c. 7. <q>The <hi>Word,</hi> ſaith he, is the <hi>Face of God,</hi> by the which he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts and makes himſelf known.—The Antients had the Old Teſtament, and the Law inſtructed them by Fear; and the <hi>Word</hi> was an <hi>Angel</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.</q> Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> relating theſe Words of <hi>Clement</hi> (in his Defence of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi>) <hi>Verbum Angelus erat,</hi> interprets them thus: <hi>Hoc eſt, per Angelos apparuit;</hi> that is to ſay, he manifeſted himſelf by the Angels (or as <hi>Clement</hi> ſpeaks, by an Angel, or by the Angel, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Angel that bore the Name of God) but he is miſtaken, if he underſtands by the Word, an <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> diſtinct from the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:200403:5"/>
                     <hi>Father;</hi> and if he means thereby that the deſign of <hi>Clement</hi> was to inſinuate to us, that the <hi>Son of God</hi> did manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the means of Angels: For who ſeeth not that theſe words of <hi>Clement, the Word is the Face of God,</hi> do denote, that the Word is the Manifeſtation of God? And theſe, <hi>the Word was an Angel,</hi> mean, that the Divine Manifeſtation was an Angel, or was perform'd by an Angel? Otherwiſe what can be the meaning of the oppoſite difference this Father makes between the <hi>Word</hi> which inſtructed the Antients by Fear, and the <hi>Word</hi> which inſtructs the New People with Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that is to ſay, between the <hi>Word Angel,</hi> and the <hi>Word Man,</hi> between God ſpeaking to the Antients by <hi>Angels,</hi> and ſpeaking to us in theſe laſt times <hi>by his own Son?</hi> This would be to no purpoſe. But if on the contrary, we underſtand by the Word, a <hi>Divine Manifeſtation,</hi> either by an <hi>Angel,</hi> or by <hi>his Son,</hi> the words of <hi>Clement</hi> will produce an excellent Senſe: He means therefore, of old an <hi>Angel</hi> was the <hi>Word,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Preſence</hi> and the <hi>Oracle</hi> of God; and this Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being <hi>ſurprizing</hi> and <hi>illuſtrious,</hi> was an Oeconomy of Fear. But now a Man like unto us is the <hi>Word</hi> of God, that is to ſay, his <hi>Preſence</hi> and his <hi>Oracle;</hi> and this Manifeſtation being more adapted to our State, becomes a Diſpenſation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcendence and Love. So that if theſe words of <hi>Clement, The Word was an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,</hi> do ſignify that God did manifeſt himſelf then by Angels; theſe words of St. <hi>John, the Word was Fleſh,</hi> will ſignify likewiſe that God doth now manifeſt himſelf to Men by the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> or, which is all one, by a Man. This is the beſt Notion we can have of the Word, if we conſult the Scriptures, without troubling our ſelves with <hi>Platonick</hi> Viſions. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> had the ſame Notion, and his Words are remarkable, ſince they give us a Definition of the Word, and at the ſame time the true Meaning of it. <q>The Word, ſaith he, is nothing elſe but the Face of God, by the which he makes himſelf known.</q> Three great Men amongſt the Reformers have had the ſame Notion.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is <hi>Bucer,</hi> who tranſlates thus the words of St. <hi>John, Et Deus erat Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum illud;</hi> conformably to the <hi>Syriac</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which hath it thus, <hi>Deus erat ipſum verbum, God was the very Word.</hi> This Tranſlation doth ſufficiently declare the Sentiment of this Divine touching the <hi>Word:</hi> He means that God, ſpeaking then without a Medium, or the Organ of a Man, or the Miniſtry of an Angel, was himſelf the Word; he put forth his Power by himſelf. He explains theſe words thus: <q>I would, ſaith he, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate the <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.</q> This Aſſertion is ſufficient; we deſire no more; let us but underſtand this Word without the <hi>Platonick</hi> Notions of <hi>Hypoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſis,</hi> a Son begotten before all Ages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> let us hold faſt the Notion of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> who never underſtood their <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>var,</hi> to be a <hi>Perſon,</hi> or a <hi>Son. Juſtin</hi> was the firſt of the <hi>Platonick Fathers,</hi> that made an <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> of a <hi>Power</hi> or a <hi>Manifeſtation,</hi> having alter'd the Ideas of the Scripture by the Prejudices he brought from the School of <hi>Plato. Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> obſerves that the <hi>Greeks, viz.</hi> the Verſion of the LXX, render the word <hi>Davar</hi> by that of <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, but only what the <hi>Hebrews</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by their <hi>Davar.</hi> 1. That Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Power which God thruſt forth, that I may ſo ſay, out of himſelf, when he was about to create the World: <hi>Verbo Domini Coeli firmati ſunt,</hi> &amp;c. And 2. That holy Breathing which ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated the Prophets, <hi>Verbum Domini
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:200403:5"/>factum eſt ad Prophetam.</hi> Now this twofold Power is found in J. C. both that which created the World, and alſo that which inſpir'd the Prophets. You ſee, in the very working of his Miracles, this <hi>Sermo,</hi> or this <hi>Juſſus Divinus,</hi> which ſaid, <hi>Let there be Light, and there was Light:</hi> His ſingle Word ſuffic'd, he needed not ſay any more than, <hi>I will it. Say only the word,</hi> ſaid the Centurion to him, <hi>and my Servant ſhall be healed.</hi> You ſee moreover, by the Unction receiv'd from the Father, this <hi>Sermo Propheticus,</hi> by the means whereof he hath declar'd to us the whole Will of God, is alſo to be ſeen: For God who ſpake at other times to the Fathers by the Prophets, hath ſpoke to us in theſe laſt Times by his own Son. In theſe two regards J. C. ſhews to the <hi>Jews</hi> that he is the <hi>Son of God,</hi> or the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf into the number of the <hi>Gods,</hi> whom God ſanctified, and to whom the Word of God came, <hi>John</hi> 10. <hi>viz.</hi> his Word of Authority and Power, and his Word of Revelation and Prophecy. 'Tis in theſe two Senſes that St. <hi>John</hi> calls him the <hi>Word;</hi> and to put a Metaphyſical Signification upon this Word, is a piece of Philoſophical Extravagancy.</p>
                  <p>Let us come now to <hi>Beza,</hi> the ſecond Interpreter I deſign to produce (on <hi>John</hi> 1.1.) This Author having related the ſubtile and Metaphyſical Thoughts of the Fathers touching the <hi>Word;</hi> 
                     <q>'Tis not likely, ſaith he, that St. <hi>John</hi> would ſpeak ſo ſubtilly on this Subject; we ought rather have regard to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> than to the <hi>Greek</hi> Phraſeology: For altho St. <hi>John</hi> writ in <hi>Greek,</hi> yet it may be ſaid, that in teaching of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and above all in revealing his Myſteries, he never departed from the uſual ways of ſpeaking uſed in the Holy Writings, and in the Synagogues, and ſuch as were underſtood by the People. Now, according to him, the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to call the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> as if it were ſaid, <hi>He of whom God had ſpoken, or whom God had promis'd;</hi> the bleſſed Seed whereof God ſpake ſo often to the Patriarchs, and whom we may call the <hi>Word,</hi> or the <hi>Promiſe of God,</hi> by way of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Unleſs it be ſaid, as he goes on, that this Name was given him, becauſe he is the only Interpreter of the Father, by whom he hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted himſelf to the World.</q> But altho this laſt Interpretation doth not pleaſe him ſo much as the former, yet he repeats continually, that all the reſt of thoſe which the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Divines embrac'd ſo greedily, do in no way agree with the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue. This is manifeſt, and hath no need of Proof. If we diſcard the Ideas of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> pretends that we ought, farewel then <hi>eternal Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi> and <hi>Generations,</hi> farewel <hi>internal Word,</hi> and <hi>Word brought forth,</hi> farewel <hi>Trin-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> and <hi>Hypoſtaſes,</hi> with all that Theological Jargon, which is pretended to be form'd upon the Stile of St. <hi>John.</hi> And if on the contrary, we go up to the Source, and ſearch into the Stile of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> themſelves what this Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt meant, the <hi>Word</hi> will then be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſo often promis'd and ſo long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> of whom God ſpake to the Patriarchs; or if you pleaſe, that Prophet who was to <hi>interpret</hi> to us, the <hi>Word</hi> of the Father, and that <hi>King of Glory,</hi> in whom the whole Power of God was to be manifeſted.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Witſius</hi> may alſo be one of thoſe Interpreters of the <hi>Logos</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi> who diſcards the <hi>Platonick</hi> Notions. He doth not ſo much as believe that St. <hi>John</hi> borrow'd this Word from either the <hi>Cabala</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſts, but from the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And ſince his Explications and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings are the ſame with thoſe of <hi>Beza</hi> concerning it, we will not count him for a ſeparate Witneſs.</p>
                  <p>The third Interpreter I ſhall alledg, is <hi>Coelius Secundus Curio,</hi> who ſpeaks thus in his <hi>Araneus:</hi> 
                     <q>The Sacred Hiſtory informs us, that ſeveral have ſeen
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:200403:6"/>God preſent, let it be ſo: but the ſame Hiſtory teacheth us, that theſe were <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>miniſtring Spirits,</hi> who holding the Place of God, did appear unto Men, and ſpake in his Name in a viſible Form and Perſon. And not this only, but the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible God being willing to make himſelf known in a more illuſtrious manner, did moreover inſinuate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into J. C. with all his Majeſty; for we read thus in the Goſpel, <hi>The Father that dwells in me, he doth the Works; and he that ſeeth me, ſeeth my Father alſo.</hi> Add to theſe the Words of the Apoſtle, <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the World to himſelf;</hi> and theſe alſo, <hi>He was pleas'd that all the Fulneſs of the Godhead ſhould dwell bodily in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </q> Doth not all this manifeſtly prove this Author plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledges, that as Angels had been the Perſon or the <hi>Word</hi> of God, J. C. was ſo likewiſe? but yet a <hi>Word</hi> more excellent, and a Perſon more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, into which God inſinuated himſelf; not <hi>God the Son,</hi> as they tell us, but <hi>God the Father,</hi> according to the Paſſage the Author quotes, <hi>Pater in me man<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

For God was that <hi>Reaſon;</hi> but ſeeing God cannot be ſeen with our Eyes, nor compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by our Mind, he was pleas'd to put on a Perſon, under which he might ſhew himſelf as it were in his natural and living Image. Now ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is an only and ſimple Being, and cannot borrow any form of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he produc'd himſelf one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, by the mean of a Voice, and a Light wholly Divine; which, becauſe he made uſe of it to inſtruct us and manifeſt himſelf, was called his <hi>Word,</hi> that is to ſay his <hi>Oracle</hi> and his <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> &amp;c. to the <hi>14th ver.</hi> where he proceeds thus: Would you have me at laſt to diſcover this great Myſtery? And tell you under what Form God came unto Men? This <hi>Word,</hi> this <hi>Reaſon,</hi> this Wiſdom, this <hi>Oracle</hi> was made <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and this <hi>Fleſh</hi> which is called Man, that he might raiſe ours to a Sovereign Immortality. A Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſis to be admir'd in all Ages? God was the <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> was the <hi>Life,</hi> the <hi>Life</hi> was the <hi>Light</hi> of Men; the <hi>Light</hi> was <hi>Fleſh,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh</hi> Man, the Man <hi>God,</hi> who is bleſſed for ever. God and Man have join'd themſelves together; for God was in J. C. <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the Word to himſelf.</hi> 'Tis on this wiſe that God, the Sovereign God <hi>(Deus, Deus ille)</hi> O Man! manifeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf in the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed amongſt us. Hence comes it that a great Prophet gives him the Name of <hi>Emanuel.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This Learned Man's Words are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable: He ſaith, that the inviſible God being willing to make himſelf known, was pleas'd to <hi>put on a Perſon,</hi> that is to ſay, give himſelf a Figure, take a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Image, under which he produced himſelf outwardly. That this Image conſiſting in a <hi>Light</hi> and a <hi>Voice,</hi> which he made uſe of to ſhew himſelf and to inſtruct us, was for that reaſon call'd his <hi>Word.</hi> So that the <hi>Word</hi> of S. <hi>John,</hi> and the <hi>Image of the inviſible God,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> has it, are the ſelf-ſame thing. Thus you have the Word excellently well defin'd, according to the Ideas of <hi>Clement;</hi> neither do I believe, that a neater and more diſtinct Notion can be formed of it, nor one more agreeing with the Scriptures, which tell us ſo often of the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> of his <hi>Face,</hi> of his <hi>Dwelling,</hi> of his <hi>Preſence,</hi> in an <hi>Angel,</hi> in a <hi>Cloud,</hi> in a <hi>Light,</hi> in a <hi>Fire,</hi> with a <hi>Clap of Thunder,</hi> with a <hi>Voice,</hi> or with a <hi>gentle</hi> and <hi>ſtill Sound;</hi> and what
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:200403:6"/>can this be I pray you, but his <hi>Perſon</hi> and his <hi>Word?</hi> You need only read <hi>Maimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> in his <hi>More Nevochim, P.</hi> 1. <hi>ch.</hi> 25, &amp; 64. where with extraordinary Clearneſs, he explains what the antient Word is, ſaying, that it is the Habitation of the Divine Majeſty and Providence in ſome certain Place, where he would make himſelf known, which he cauſeth to dart forth miraculouſly, under the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of a created Light. Would you have the ſame Word under the N. Teſtament? Conſider the extraordinary Providence that preſided at the Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Meſſiah; behold an Angel that ſpeaks, and is the <hi>Voice of God</hi> on this occaſion, a Spirit overſhadowing the Holy Virgin, the which reſembles ſo much the light Cloud that cover'd the Tabernacle; behold the <hi>Habitation</hi> of God in the Meſſiah, dwelling himſelf amongſt us: In a word, ſee the Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Father in the Son, whoſe Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry we have beheld. If this will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, get up the Mount to the Transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of J.

                     <hi>Irenaeus</hi> had no other Idea of the <hi>Word, Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 37. where he ſaith: <q>That the <hi>Word</hi> deſigning to ſhew God in its ſundry Diſpenſations, ſhew'd him made like to a Man, that by this mean he preſerv'd to the Father his Inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, leſt Man ſhould come to deſpiſe him: that if the <hi>Manifeſtation</hi> of God, which was at the Creation of the World, did give Life unto Men; how much more will the <hi>Manifeſtation</hi> of the Father by the <hi>Word,</hi> give Life to all thoſe who ſee God on this wiſe? That the Prophets never ſaw the <hi>Face of God</hi> uncover'd, but only certain Diſpenſations and certain Myſteries, by which God began to ſhew himſelf; that theſe firſt Sketches of the Divine Manifeſtation, were only the Preludes of that which was to be made by J.

That the Father is inviſible in Truth, that no Perſon ever ſaw him; but that the <hi>Word</hi> manag'd the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of the <hi>Father,</hi> and ſhew'd their Glory, as it thought fit.</q> 
                     <hi>Irenaeus</hi> tells us afterwards, <q>That the <hi>Word</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under different Figures, of a <hi>Man,</hi> a <hi>Wind,</hi> a <hi>Light,</hi> a <hi>Cloud,</hi> a <hi>Fire,</hi> &amp;c.</q> which diſcovers to us, that all <hi>external Manifeſtation,</hi> whether it be by <hi>Angels,</hi> or by the <hi>Fleſh</hi> of J. C. is the <hi>Word</hi> of God; as all <hi>internal Communication,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be by an Angel, or by an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Virtue, is the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> And all this is call'd the <hi>Oeconomy;</hi> or, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaith, they are <hi>myſterious</hi> and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> of the Divinity, which environ his Majeſty to temper its great Splendor, and adapt it to our Curioſity. For to imagine that this is a ſecond Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Divinity, as <hi>inviſible</hi> and as <hi>infinite</hi> as the firſt, would make all the Reaſonings of the antient Fathers, not only uſeleſs, but alſo abſurd; for they all unanimouſly declare, not only that the Father never makes himſelf <hi>viſible,</hi> but alſo that he cannot do ſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>It is impoſſible, ſaith <hi>Euſebius, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtr. Evang. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. That the Eyes of Mortals ſhould ever ſee the Supreme God, to wit, him who is above all things, and whoſe Eſſence is unbegotten and immutable. It is abſurd and againſt all reaſon, ſaith the ſame Author (<hi>Hiſt.

If the Son, ſaith he, were as incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible as the Father, the Objection of the Hereticks would have ſome ground, that then <hi>there are two Gods.</hi> It is an Impiety, ſay the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the Council of <hi>Antioch (Epiſt. adv. Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Samoſat.)</hi> to fancy that that God who is above all things, can be called an Angel.</q> Laſtly (otherwiſe I muſt tranſcribe all the Fathers) <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> explains himſelf on this wiſe in his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue with <hi>Tryphon:</hi> 
                     <q>No body, ſaith he, unleſs he be out of his Wits, will dare to advance, that the <hi>Father</hi> and Author of all things did quit the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, to cauſe himſelf to be ſeen in a ſmall part of the Earth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I thought to have finiſhed, but that I can by no means paſs by that excellent Paſſage of <hi>Tertullian</hi> againſt <hi>Praxeas</hi> (<hi>cap.</hi> 16.) <q>That he would not believe that the Sovereign God deſcended into the Womb of a Woman, tho even the Scripture it ſelf ſhould ſay it. This Father being perſuaded by Reaſon and Philoſophy, that the ſupreme God is immenſe, immutable and inviſible, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands how it could come to paſs, that the Almighty God, whoſe Throne is the Heaven, and the Earth his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool, that this moſt high God ſhould walk in the terreſtrial Paradiſe, ſhould converſe with <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſhould call to <hi>Moſes</hi> out of a Buſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and what is yet worſe, that he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, according to <hi>Praxeas,</hi> into the Womb of <hi>Mary;</hi> that he ſhould be impeached before <hi>Pilate,</hi> and be ſhut up in the Sepulcher of <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
                     </q> He goes on, <q>Really one would not believe this concerning the Son, if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did not ſpeak it; and perhaps would not believe it of the <hi>Father,</hi> tho even the Scripture ſhould ſay it.</q> How ſo! would he miſtruſt the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? No, he means only, that he ſhould miſtruſt the literal ſenſe, and ſearch there for an Allegory. Conſequently then all theſe Fathers own that the Word by which the Father makes himſelf viſible, is not of a Nature incapable of cauſing it ſelf to be ſeen, but ſomething ſenſible, which repreſents God to us. It matters not whether they conceive by it an <hi>Hypoſtaſis,</hi> a <hi>Spirit,</hi> an <hi>intelligent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or any other kind of <hi>Repreſentation</hi> in a bright Cloud animated with a Voice. This will always remain true, that they did not underſtand the <hi>Word</hi> to be a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> equal to the <hi>Father,</hi> as inviſible by its Nature as the Father, but only a certain <hi>Emanation,</hi> where God produceth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf outwardly, and diſcovers himſelf in a ſenſible manner. And tho they might have ſometimes ſpoken of the Word, as of ſomething <hi>inviſible,</hi> they meant not by this that it was <hi>inviſible</hi> by its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but only that it was not viſible to Men out of the time of its <hi>Oeconomy,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring it ſelf from their <hi>Preſence,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming as it were hid in God. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they would denote by it, even the <hi>Energy</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with his <hi>Manifeſtation</hi> is always accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but never a ſecond <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> in the Divine Nature. For we muſt obſerve here ſincerely once for all, that the <hi>Word,</hi> if you conſider it only in its <hi>Energy,</hi> is no other thing but God himſelf; but when it is conſider'd as it is a Mark of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Preſence, then it is ſomething ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, a <hi>Voice,</hi> a <hi>Light,</hi> or ſome external Form, ſuch like as was ſeen in <hi>Angels,</hi> or in the Man J. C. our Lord.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The Antients believed that the Word was Corporeal.</head>
                  <p>WHerefore the Antients attributed a Body to the Word, as <hi>Serve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> very well obſerved <hi>(Apolog. ad Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip. Melanct.)</hi> and ſo <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks in his Book of the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt againſt <hi>Praxeas, chap.</hi> 7. where he proves at large, that when God utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Word, he gave it a Body, indeed not a Body of Fleſh, but an Hypoſtaſis, that is, Solidity and Subſtance, which is the true Signification of the Word. That's probably what he means, when in <hi>chap.</hi> 6. of the Book <hi>of the Fleſh of Chriſt,</hi> he aſſures that Jeſus Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>Abraham</hi> with Fleſh, which was not yet born <hi>(non nata adhuc)</hi> that is to ſay, not indeed with ſuch Fleſh as ours, but with a ſolid Body, which had more than appearance. A Body, I ſay, which he in the <hi>8th</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter calls the Seed of God; from which as from a Heavenly Seed the Meſſiah was to be born: and this Seed is the Holy Ghoſt, or the Subſtance of the Word, which inſinuated it ſelf into it.</p>
                  <p>Thence the antient <hi>Docetes,</hi> and all the other Hereticks who held the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtence of the Word, ſuppos'd that the Word did not take true Fleſh of <hi>Mary,</hi> but that he contented himſelf with the Celeſtial and Etherial Body, which he formerly bore in the Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Old Teſtament, which had no more than the Appearance and Figure of a Man, which the Scripture calls the Face of God. Monſ. <hi>le Moyne</hi> did not underſtand the thing otherwiſe in his <hi>Varia ſacra, p.</hi> 415. <q>The <hi>Docetes,</hi> ſays he, compared the Apparitions of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to the Apparitions of the Old Teſtament, which having been in Etherial Bodies for certain times, vaniſhed into the Air as ſoon as the Diſpenſation was finiſh'd, imagining that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt was not of any other Nature. And it is in the ſame ſenſe, that <hi>Cerinthus</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bion</hi> ſuppos'd that Jeſus Chriſt had not taken true Fleſh, as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> aſſures in the Preface to his Commentary on St. <hi>Matthew.</hi>
                     </q> As <hi>Cerinthus</hi> held (<hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 25. <hi>Epiph. Haereſ.</hi> 28.) That the World had been created by a Power; he alſo maintain'd that Jeſus, who was begotten of the Seed of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> was the Son of the Creator. As to the Chriſt or the Word, he made him the Son of another Power ſuperiour to the Creator, and attributed to him a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Body, which he had always kept without mixing it with the Fleſh of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. For we cannot think he ſuppos'd, that Jeſus the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> had not Fleſh like ours: He meant nothing more than that the Word, or the Chriſt, as he is pleas'd to call him, had not appear'd to Men, but with a Body wholly celeſtial and impaſſible; ſo ſeparating Jeſus from the Chriſt, and making two Natures of them, as St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> informs us. It is with reaſon wonder'd that ſo grave Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have ſaid, and ſo often repeated, that <hi>Cerinthus</hi>'s Hereſy conſiſted in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Divine Nature of Jeſus Chriſt, when he is the firſt who brings the two Natures of Jeſus Chriſt into the Chriſtian Religion; the Divine Nature which he believed to be impaſſible, and which he makes to deſcend from Heaven, and the Humane which he believed to be begotten by <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi> But there is yet greater reaſon to wonder,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:200403:8"/>that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> has been quoted for it, who ſays nothing leſs than what Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts make him ſay. All that that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſays, concerning the Error which St. <hi>John</hi> oppos'd in <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> is, that the World had been created by an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our God, or by an Angel; but that there was another ſuperiour God, who had ſent his Word or the Holy Ghoſt in the ſhape of a Dove, into the Son of <hi>Mary:</hi> That the inferiour Chriſt, who was called Jeſus, was indeed the Son of the Creator; but that the ſuperiour Chriſt, who deſcended into the other, was the Son of the moſt high and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known God; who after having render'd Jeſus capable of working Miracles, and of manifeſting the unknown God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelf into his <hi>Pleroma</hi> when Jeſus was to ſuffer. <hi>Iren. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>This Opinion was not ſo much <hi>Plato</hi>'s as <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi>'s, who believed that God had never done any thing but by Angels. Some Hereticks added, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the God of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who was one of thoſe Angels, and Creator of the Univerſe, there was another God who had never manifeſted himſelf until he made himſelf known by the Coming of the Chriſt. Indeed it ſeems that this is the only Error, which St. <hi>John</hi> oppoſes in his Goſpel. Firſt he ſhews, therein following the Pſalmiſt, St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that the World was not made by any other than by the Word, or by the Power of God; that this Word was not an Efficacy or Power diſtinct or ſeparate from the moſt High God, that is an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel or ſelf-ſubſiſting Hypoſtaſis; but that it was in God the Creator as his Efficacy, or to ſay better, that it was the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor himſelf. Then he ſhews that the Word, the Spirit, or the ſuperior Chriſt who deſcended into Jeſus, who dwelt in him, and who had wrought ſo many Miracles, was not an Hypoſtaſis, or an emanated Efficacy of another God than he who had created the World, but the proper Efficacy of God the Creator, the ſame Word which having created the World, was united to Jeſus Chriſt, and manifeſted in him. The Word by which all things were made, ſays he, was made Fleſh, or manifeſted in the Fleſh. Which ſhews, that Chriſt was the Son of the Creator, and not of another God ſuperiour to him; and that the World was not made by an Angel, but by the moſt high God.</p>
                  <p>Monſ. <hi>le Moyne,</hi> among others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, that St. <hi>John</hi> aim'd at oppoſing this Error. St. <hi>John</hi> aſſures, ſays he, <hi>Varia ſacra, p.</hi> 407. that the Word was made Fleſh, in oppoſition to the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the phantaſtick Body of Chriſt. He has no other Deſign in his firſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, where he teaches that Chriſt is come in the Fleſh, and proteſts that he preaches and inſiſts on no other Word of Life, than that which he had ſeen, heard and touched; that is, according to him, that Chriſt came no otherwiſe than in a real Body, and no way in an etherial one. If we inclin'd to believe that St. <hi>John</hi> aim'd at <hi>Cerinthus</hi> in writing his Goſpel, we might add that it is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that as often as this Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh relates Jeſus Chriſt's ſaying, that he deſcended from Heaven, he always makes him ſpeak as if he directly oppos'd that Heretick. For whereas <hi>Cerinthus</hi> ſaid, that the Chriſt or a Spiritual Nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from Heaven, Jeſus Chriſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures on the contrary that 'tis the Son of Man, that 'tis his own Fleſh which deſcended from thence; Man, as you ſee, and not a Nature diſtinct from Man; Fleſh, and not a Spirit. 'Tis pity that Heretick did not live in the time of our Lord; one might have the Pleaſure of forming a curious Syſtem on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which would not be leſs well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, than that which has been built on the Word of St. <hi>John</hi> with reſpect to that Heretick. But if we cannot po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively aſſert, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or his Diſciple did attack <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> we may at leaſt affirm, that 'twas againſt him, or his like, that St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> diſputed; <q>They hold, ſays that Father, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 17,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:200403:8"/>18, 19, &amp; 20. that indeed <hi>Jeſus</hi> is born of <hi>Mary;</hi> but that as to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he deſcended from above— ſo dividing the Lord, by ſaying that he is compoſed of two Subſtances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> With their Mouths they confeſs but one <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but in reality they have two— one <hi>paſſible,</hi> and the other <hi>deſcending from Heaven, inviſible and impaſſible</hi>— not knowing that the <hi>Word</hi> which was united to and mix'd with his Work, and which was made <hi>Fleſh,</hi> is it ſelf that <hi>Jeſus</hi> who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd for us.— But if one ſuffer'd while the other remain'd <hi>impaſſible,</hi> it is not one <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but two.— Now every Spirit which divides <hi>Jeſus Chriſt (qui ſolvit Jeſum, Vulg.)</hi> is not of God.— What hinder'd the Apoſtles from ſaying, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> deſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Jeſus;</hi> or the Saviour who is above the Oeconomy, into him who is of the Oeconomy? But the Apoſtles neither knew nor ſaid any thing like it. What there was of it, they ſaid, to wit, that the Spirit deſcended on him like a Dove.</q> It appears by this Paſſage, and by the whole Work of St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> that his Opinion was, that the <hi>Word</hi> was made <hi>Fleſh,</hi> not only in communicating it ſelf to the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> which the Hereticks believ'd, but alſo in mixing it ſelf with the <hi>Fleſh.</hi> And therefore in the <hi>21ſt</hi> Chapter of the ſame Book, he twice calls him the <hi>Word mix'd and blended (commixtum Verbum.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame Theology is found in <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatian, de Trinitate,</hi> c. 11, &amp; 19. In one place he maintains that Jeſus is not only a <hi>Man,</hi> but that he is likewiſe <hi>God</hi> according to the Scripture, becauſe the Divinity of the <hi>Word</hi> enter'd into the Compoſition, and mix'd it ſelf with the <hi>Fleſh (Divinitate Sermonis in ipſa concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione permixta.)</hi> In another place like unto this, he takes upon himſelf to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that the <hi>Word</hi> having by its <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> and by its <hi>Mixture</hi> with the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> aſſociated to it ſelf the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> made him what he was not, to wit, the <hi>Son of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Origen</hi> ſays as much of it in his third Book againſt <hi>Celſus:</hi> 
                     <q>The Humanity of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſays he, rais'd it ſelf to ſuch a degree of Divinity, not only by the Communication of the <hi>Word,</hi> but alſo by its <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> and by its <hi>Mixture</hi> therewith <hi>(permixtione)</hi> that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>God.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tertullian</hi> carrys the matter yet farther in his Book <hi>of the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, Ch.</hi> 16. For he ſuppoſes that, <q>As the Clay whereof <hi>Adam</hi> was formed, was converted into true Fleſh, ſo the <hi>Word of God</hi> is converted into the Subſtance of the ſame Fleſh.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence I infer that theſe antient Doctors believ'd the <hi>Word</hi> to be <hi>corporeal,</hi> and capable of being compounded with the <hi>Fleſh;</hi> ſo that as the <hi>Fleſh</hi> has by this mixture been in a manner deify'd, the <hi>incorporated</hi> and <hi>incarnated Word</hi> has like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe been render'd paſſible. I ſay <hi>paſſible,</hi> taking the Word according to its literal Signification, and not by the Figure of the communication of Idioms, as we are uſed to ſpeak. For otherwiſe they would have owned two Natures in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the one <hi>paſſible,</hi> and the other <hi>impaſſible,</hi> which is the very Opinion they oppos'd. It is plain, that according to <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> the Hereticks ſaid, that the <hi>Chriſt</hi> had been made two Subſtances, or, as he ſpeaks, Subſtance and Subſtance <hi>(altera &amp; altera Subſtantia.)</hi> Now what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence would there be between two Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and two Natures? Let us then ſay that they could not be any otherwiſe refuted, than by ſuppoſing, that the <hi>Word</hi> with the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> made but one <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or but one <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who from <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſible</hi> as he was, made himſelf <hi>paſſible</hi> for our ſakes. If there be any other Subſtance diſtinct from the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which deſcended on him, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> teaches us, that 'tis no other than the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as the Evangeliſts aſſure us. The <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> held that <hi>Chriſt</hi> deſcended into <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus;</hi> thence <hi>Irenaeus</hi> infers that they made two <hi>Chriſts.</hi> Now if the Orthodox had held that the <hi>Son of God</hi> deſcended into
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:200403:9"/>the <hi>Son of Mary,</hi> 'twas natural thence to draw the ſame conſequence, that then they made two Sons of God. The <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks</hi> did not deny that the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> had true Fleſh, and that he really ſuffer'd: They only taught, that Chriſt who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended into him, contenting himſelf with his Celeſtial and Etherial Body, did not ſo unite himſelf to the Fleſh of the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> as to have truly ſuffer'd with him; and therein they divided <hi>Chriſt. Irenaeus</hi> would no leſs have divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Chriſt</hi> into two, if he had believed, that the <hi>Word</hi> always remain'd <hi>impaſſible,</hi> while the Man whereunto it was united, did ſuffer. He could not therefore refute them, but by ſuppoſing, that this <hi>Word</hi> ſo united it ſelf to the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> that from being <hi>impaſſible</hi> as it had been before, it became <hi>paſſible,</hi> almoſt as our Soul is ſo join'd to our Body, that it ſuffers with it.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> now hold, that the Divine Nature did not ſuffer, they are in the ſame Opinion with thoſe Hereticks: and if by reaſon of the Union of the two Natures, they can ſay that the <hi>Son of God</hi> or the <hi>Word</hi> ſuffer'd, becauſe one of the two Natures did ſuffer; the Hereticks might alſo have ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not ſuffer, becauſe one of the two Subſtances had not ſuffer'd. And that the rather, becauſe 'twas the Subſtance which had the Perſonality, whereto the Actions and Paſſions do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long: For who doubts but that they were provided with many diſtinctions? What <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaid in Chap. 21. of the ſame Book, may be objected to the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which I aſcribe to him, <hi>viz.</hi> that <q>the <hi>Word</hi> ſuſpended his efficacy, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> might die.</q> But that does not ſignify that the <hi>Word</hi> did not ſuffer, but that he would not make uſe of his Power to hinder himſelf from ſuffering, as appears by the following oppoſite Propoſition: <q>That the Man was abſorb'd, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> might riſe again.</q> Which does not exclude the Man from Reſurrection, but means only, that his Infirmities and his Nothingneſs brought no obſtacle thereto, having been ſurmounted by the Power which rais'd him from the Dead. We might ſupport this Hypotheſis with many Paſſages of the Epiſtles of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> but that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion would carry us too far. It is to be remember'd that we give only an Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, and not a compleat Diſſertation on the Word of St. <hi>John.</hi>

                  <p>AFter having ſpoken of the outward <hi>Manifeſtation</hi> of God, I come to the manner whereby he communicates himſelf inwardly. God is a rich Spring which hath always been diffuſing it ſelf; which he hath done either by inſinuating himſelf into all his Works, into which he hath inſpired Soul and Life, ſo that there is not any part of the Univerſe which bears not ſome ſtrokes and Rays of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity: or by ſhedding his extraordinary Favours into thoſe of his intelligent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whom he has often choſe to be the Interpreters of his Will. With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the former, his Communication is call'd the <hi>Spirit,</hi> or the <hi>Breath</hi> of God: The Spirit mov'd upon the Deep, to ſtir the confuſed Maſs of the World, and prepare Matter for the <hi>Word of God,</hi> who framed the ſeveral Parts of it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:200403:9"/>the Author of <hi>Pimander</hi> did not conjecture amiſs, when he thinks that what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> which moved upon the Deep, is to be underſtood of the <hi>Word of God.</hi> It's the ſame <hi>Spirit,</hi> but in a more noble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, which inſinuated it ſelf as the Breath of God into the Body of <hi>Adam,</hi> to inſpire into him <hi>Knowledg</hi> and <hi>Reaſon.</hi> God's <hi>Hands</hi> made him, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God gave him Life: Two Powers which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accompany each other in the Work of the Creation.

The <hi>Word</hi> of God, ſays he, ſignifies no other than his <hi>Will.</hi> But becauſe Men cannot preſently apprehend how a thing can be made by the Will only, thinking it neceſſary, that he who will make any thing, muſt either do it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or cauſe it to be done by others; the Scripture ſays, that God commands that a thing be, when he will have it to be, not only by compariſon to our manner of acting, but alſo becauſe thoſe Expreſſions do alſo ſignify the <hi>Will.</hi> So as often as in the Work of the Creation we meet with the words, <hi>God ſaid,</hi> it is the ſame as <hi>God willed:</hi> And theſe, that the Heavens were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by the <hi>Word of God,</hi> is the ſame thing as by the <hi>Spirit of his Mouth:</hi> For as his <hi>Mouth</hi> and his <hi>Spirit</hi> are Metaphorical Expreſſions, ſo his <hi>Speech</hi> and his <hi>Word</hi> are alſo Metaphorical, the meaning whereof is, that things exiſt by his <hi>Will only.</hi>

                     </q> Whence it appears that in Scripture, ſaying that the <hi>Hands</hi> of God laid the Foundations of the Earth, or that he laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of it by <hi>his Word,</hi> or by <hi>his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> are equivalent Expreſſions; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that there is no Myſtery in this Term <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Speech.</hi> Otherwiſe we muſt ſeek it alſo in <hi>Hand, Finger, Mouth, &amp;c.</hi> and make of 'em ſo many Perſons of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> 'Twould be much more proper to ſay with the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> as above noted, that thereby is ſignify'd nothing more with reſpect to God, than that the doing great Works coſts him but <hi>one ſingle Word.</hi> In truth, this literal Senſe is much more reaſonable than the ſuppos'd Myſtery.</p>
                  <p>But I ſaid, in the ſecond place, that there is another more excellent <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> when God fills with his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Gifts, and, if I may ſo ſpeak, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflows with his Favours, thoſe of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind whom he appoints to execute his Decrees, as his Prophets and other Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers; and particularly the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> whom he ſent into the World with all the Characters of an extraordinary <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration.</hi> This latter kind of <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> is called the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> And here again we ſee on the one hand, the <hi>Word</hi> and the Commiſſion of God addreſs'd to his Miniſter; and on the other, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> confirming God's Order to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and conferring on him Power to diſcharge all the Duties of his Office.

But here it muſt be obſerv'd, with reſpect to Prophetical <hi>Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that there are two kinds of it, whereof each hath its ſpecifick Character. The firſt, which was when God ſpake by the Prophets, was only for particular Diſpenſations, for certain Times and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrys. The other, which was demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to whom the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature was communicated in a much more perfect manner, was inſeparable and perpetual. The firſt is called the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> the ſecond is not only called the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> but alſo the <hi>Word,</hi> becauſe <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was not only a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet by reaſon of the Gifts received from the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> but alſo becauſe he was <hi>begotten a Prophet, and born a Prophet:</hi> a diſtinction which raiſes him infinitely above all other Prophets.</p>
                  <p>This is the Truth which St. <hi>John</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to teach us in writing the Preface, or Prologue to his Evangelical Hiſtory, <hi>viz.</hi> that the ſame <hi>Jeſus</hi> who was born of a Woman, was born the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or is the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in right, and by the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his Birth. And the reaſon which he gives for it is, that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> or the <hi>Word,</hi> for that's the ſame thing, did not only make his Fleſh, but alſo inſinuating himſelf into it, as the antient Doctors ſpeak, did there ſow the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of his Prophetical Operations, in the ſame manner as our bodily. Fathers do not only give us Birth, but often tranſmit to us the Seeds of their Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Vertues. Now that which had never been ſeen in any other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, obliged the Evangeliſt to call <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> to diſtinguiſh him from all other Prophets and Interpreters of God, and to expreſs himſelf in ſo forcible a manner on the Birth of this great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, in ſaying that the <hi>Word was made Fleſh.</hi> The old Tranſlation was, <hi>Verbum Domini factum eſt ad Prophetam.</hi> The new has ſomething more emphatical,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:200403:10"/>
                     <hi>Verbum Domini factum eſt caro;</hi> the Word inſinuated it ſelf into the Fleſh, and prepared it for Prophecy.</p>

                     <q>That there is a double <hi>Energy</hi> or Operation of the <hi>Word,</hi> the one in a <hi>manifeſt</hi> way, <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Fleſh; the other in a ſecret way, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Whereupon he calls the <hi>Father,</hi> a <hi>Voice in ſilence;</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> the <hi>Voice;</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the <hi>Voice of the Voice.</hi>
                     </q> Which ſhews that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Son,</hi> as the <hi>Son</hi> is the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Father.</hi> And it is in this manner that St. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſpeaks, 5 <hi>adverſ. Eunom.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now we ſee by what means Error was introduc'd. God having reveal'd himſelf to his Creature by way of outward <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation,</hi> and by way of inward <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,</hi> out of thoſe two Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been made ſo many Divine <hi>Perſons,</hi> diſtinct from God the Father; that is, a ſecond Perſon was made of the <hi>Manifeſtation,</hi> and of the <hi>Communication</hi> was made a third. It is however but one and the ſame God, one and the ſame Divine Perſon, one God <hi>manifeſting</hi> himſelf, one God <hi>communicating</hi> himſelf: In a word, one God, who in <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating</hi> himſelf, and in <hi>manifeſting</hi> himſelf, varys his Character according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of his <hi>Oeconomies.</hi> He changes <hi>Oeconomy,</hi> but, as we ſpeak, without changing <hi>Perſon;</hi> (for I take this Word here according to the Philoſophical Ideas, which are the ſame with thoſe of the common People, and not in the ſenſe of Claſſical Authors, according to which it is certain God changes <hi>Perſon</hi> as often as he changes <hi>Character</hi> and <hi>Diſpenſation.</hi>) And indeed whether God clothe himſelf with a Body of moſt pure Light, an Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy proper for Angels; or ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Patriarchs under tranſitory Forms, an <hi>Oeconomy</hi> proper for particular Circumſtances; or make his fix'd abode among us in the Perſon of his Son, an <hi>Oeconomy</hi> proper for the calling of all Nations; it is ſtill the ſame God, one God <hi>manifeſting himſelf.</hi> Again, whether God give his Creature Life and Motion, or kindle in Man the Light of Reaſon, or inſpire Prophets, or ſhed forth an immenſe Influence upon the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> whom he ſends to us; 'tis yet always the ſame God, one God <hi>communicating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> 'Tis the ſame who appears every where; the ſame who makes himſelf to be known by Angels thro the brightneſs which encompaſſeth him; the ſame who by his powerful Voice commands all things to come out of nothing, and they obey him; the ſame who ſhews himſelf to the Patriarchs in momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Apparitions of Angels; the ſame who diſcovers himſelf ſomewhat more plainly, when he declares his Counſels to us by the Mouths of his Prophets. In fine, the ſame who dwelling in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſhews us his Majeſty openly in all its fulneſs, if I may ſo expreſs my ſelf after St. <hi>Paul: In Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſays that Apoſtle, <hi>dwells the fulneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head bodily;</hi> in him greater than the Angels, better authorized than <hi>Moſes,</hi> and more enlighten'd than the Prophets. This is a Myſtery of Love and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion, by which that Supreme and ineffable Being, who dwells in Light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible, comes and dwells among us, and accommodating himſelf to our weak Apprehenſion, makes himſelf be heard by our Ears, ſeen by our Eyes, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven felt by our Hands.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> God reveals himſelf only by corporeal Repreſentations, ſuted to the Narrowneſs of our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</head>
                  <p>THIS <hi>Oeconomy</hi> is general: It runs throout the whole Scripture, where God, with the Goodneſs of a Father, explains his Perfections to us by Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations tending to help our Weakneſs. 1. Becauſe we cannot apprehend his <hi>Eternity,</hi> and how he is neceſſarily Self-exiſtent. He ſpeaks of it as a Man, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us that he was before the Mountains were born, before the Heavens were ſtretched out, and the Stars lighted. Which, by the way, overthrows the Objection taken from God's neceſſary <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> to ſhew, that if we deny the <hi>Trinity</hi> becauſe it is incomprehenſible, we ſhould for the ſame reaſon alſo deny this neceſſary Exiſtence, as being no leſs ſo. I ſay, this Objection does not reach us, ſince the ſame God who in condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to us declares his <hi>Eternity</hi> and <hi>Exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> by Ideas, proportion'd to our Capacitys, would not have deliver'd this ſuppoſed <hi>Trinity</hi> to us by Ideas, not only incomprehenſible, but even deſtructive of his Unity, and of the Revelation which he has made of it. 2. Becauſe 'tis impoſſible for us to apprehend his <hi>Immenſity,</hi> he only makes us conceive it by the Idea of a great King, whoſe Throne is the Heavens, and the Earth his Footſtool. And 3. Becauſe we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of framing any true Idea of his Power, and of his other Perfections, he ſpeaks of himſelf, as of a Man having <hi>Eyes, Hands, Ears, Bowels,</hi> &amp;c. to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify to us his <hi>Knowledg, Power, Mercy, Wiſdom,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſo well underſtood this Stile of the Scripture, that he places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the falſe Ideas which Men have of the Godhead (<hi>De Trinit. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 1.) that which is uſed to expreſs its Perfections in Terms merely Metaphyſical, and which are not borrowed from any of the things in being. <q>The Scripture, ſays he, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſed any other than corporeal Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes to expreſs the Nature of God to us by; not that the thing is ſo, but to ſhew us that it is neceſſary to ſpeak ſo. As to things which are not,</q> (He means, which are not in the Creature, but are preſumptuouſly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be in God, or which have no other Being than only in Philoſophical Contemplations, which are called <hi>Ideas,</hi> or <hi>Entia Rationis</hi>) <q>the Scripture does not from them take any manner of ſpeaking, to mark out the Figures of them to us, or to make Enigma's (that is, <hi>Myſteries</hi>) of them for us. Nothing is more dangerous than to imagine that in God, which is neither in himſelf,</q> nor in any Creature. But the Paraphraſe of Mr. <hi>Du Pin</hi> will be leſs ſuſpected than my Tranſlation (<hi>Hiſt. of Eccl. Auth.</hi> Tom. 3. p. 467. Par. Edit.) <q>Thus ſome, ſays he, to form an Idea of God which may have nothing in common with the Creature, conceive him in a Chimerical manner. The Holy Scripture is accommodated to Mens Weakneſs, in ſometimes attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to God ſuch Expreſſions as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſure only to Bodys, or to imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Spirits; and has rarely made uſe of ſuch Names which are agreeing to God only, becauſe it is in this Life very difficult to know the Subſtance and Eſſence of the Divine Nature.</q> To this Paraphraſe I will add a few
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:200403:11"/>Words of the ſame Father (<hi>ib. c.</hi> 12.) <q>There is not, ſays he, in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures any manner of ſpeaking, but what is us'd among Men, becauſe 'tis indeed to Men to whom it ſpeaks.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Minutius Felix</hi> diſcourſes almoſt in the ſame manner, on the Knowledg which we can have of that immenſe and infinite Nature. For after having ſaid, that <q>God as he is in himſelf, is known by none by himſelf:</q> He add, <q>I will ſay what I think: He who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves he knows God's Greatneſs dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes it; and he who fears diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, does not know it.</q> Could he more plainly tell us, that we cannot have a right Idea of God, but in dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing his Perfections, and contenting our ſelves to compare them to the higheſt Idea of Greatneſs, which we can frame of them ourſelves. Conceiving other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of him with <hi>Eternity,</hi> which has neither <hi>paſt</hi> nor <hi>future;</hi> with <hi>Immenſity,</hi> which fills no ſpace; with <hi>Trine-unity,</hi> &amp;c. is conceiving chimerically of him. Let it then be undiſputable, That God makes himſelf known to us only by Characters, which are common to him with his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or extremely well proportion'd to our Ideas.</p>
                  <p>We have hitherto ſaid, that 'tis a kind of Figure which repreſents God to us according to the manner of Men: But perhaps it has not been obſerved, that this Stile is grounded on the Angel of God's appearing in his Name, and by his Authority, who was called his <hi>Face,</hi> his <hi>Glory,</hi> his <hi>Habitation</hi> and his <hi>Preſence,</hi> that is to ſay, who was his <hi>Word</hi> and his <hi>Oracle;</hi> this Angel, I ſay, appearing moſt commonly in the Shape and Figure of a Man. Some of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients were bold enough to ſay, that this <hi>Word</hi> ſhew'd himſelf to the Patriarchs in the ſame ſhape of Face, with which Jeſus Chriſt ſhould one day appear; and they ſuppos'd (as <hi>Servetus</hi> has well explain'd it, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 108, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>) That the <hi>Word</hi> was no other than God's <hi>Perſon,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Image</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God <hi>manifeſted</hi> himſelf; and that that <hi>Image</hi> was the very ſhape of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> Man, there being, according to them, but one only Divine <hi>Perſon,</hi> one only <hi>Face,</hi> one only <hi>Repreſentation,</hi> which has always been the ſame, whether in God's immediately ſhewing himſelf in created <hi>Light,</hi> or in <hi>Angels,</hi> or in the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who ſpake to us in his Name. And 'tis in this ſenſe that we may ſay, that the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the Son is <hi>Eternal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis eaſy to apprehend the Mind of the Fathers. They meant that the <hi>Word</hi> was no other than the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> Man, who being in God's Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding from all Eternity, was put forth in a viſible Form; God, who deſigned to manifeſt himſelf in time by his <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> having from the beginning, even in the Creation of the Univerſe, given Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes of his great Deſign, in ſhewing himſelf to either Angels or Men, only under the viſible Form, which his Son was in time to have, which he deſcrib'd in the Symbol of the <hi>Manifeſtation,</hi> and of his <hi>Preſence,</hi> whether by an <hi>Angel,</hi> by <hi>Light,</hi> or by a <hi>Cloud.</hi> So that to ſpeak properly, the <hi>Word</hi> was made <hi>Fleſh,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſame Power which made the World, became the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and the ſame <hi>ſhape of Face</hi> which appear'd to the Patriarchs, was made the <hi>ſhape of his Face,</hi> and the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of his Fleſh. I do not defend this Opinion of the Fathers, I only ſhew what it was, without obliging my ſelf to maintain it; and this ought likewiſe to be underſtood of all their other Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſes.</p>
                  <p>Be that as it will, the Patriarchs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by thoſe kind of <hi>Apparitions</hi> accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd to repreſent God to themſelves in humane Shape, God was alſo pleas'd to ſpeak to them of his <hi>Perfections,</hi> in a manner ſuted to the <hi>Idea</hi> of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which they had fram'd to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:200403:12"/>the ſeveral <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which the Scripture calls the <hi>Eyes, Hands</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> of God. It is true, that the Paraphraſt intending to ſoften all thoſe Expreſſions, which ſeem to attribute to God corporeal Parts and human Paſſions unworthy of his Majeſty, did in their ſtead uſe this Term, <hi>The Word of God,</hi> which ſeems to bring into our Minds more Spiritual Ideas of the ſupreme Deity. But he did not conſider, that if 'tis unworthy of God to have <hi>Eyes, Hands</hi> and <hi>Ears</hi> attributed to him, it will not be leſs ſo to give him a <hi>Mouth, Breath,</hi> a <hi>Voice</hi> and <hi>Speech.</hi> So that it muſt be granted, that if by a kind of Figure the Scripture mentions <hi>the Eyes of God, the Hands of God,</hi> &amp;c. it is by the ſame Figure that we ſay <hi>the Breath of God,</hi> and the <hi>Word of God.</hi> Whereby all the Myſtery pretended to be found in this latter Expreſſion muſt vaniſh, and we learn not to philoſophize ſo nicely on the <hi>Oeconemies,</hi> wherein God takes vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Forms to make himſelf the better known to us, or on manners of ſpeaking, which he has ſuted to our weak Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                  <p>IT has been ſaid of the moſt famous Philoſophers, <hi>Pythagoras, Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> that they heard the <hi>Voice of God.</hi> Which rightly underſtood, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies no more than that they had heard that ſilent Language of the Heavens, which publiſh the Glory of God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Works of his Hands. <hi>Clemens Alexandr.</hi> (<hi>Strom. l.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 547.) who ſo explains it, ſay further: <q>That thoſe Philoſophers, conſidering the Structure of the Univerſe heard <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> himſelf ſaying, <hi>God ſpake and things were made,</hi> and teaching them that the Word was the Work of God, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.</q> And in truth, after throughly philoſophizing on the Principles of the World, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways came thence to conclude and ſay, that it was the Production of an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and of an <hi>infus'd Spirit</hi> which animated it. And they held theſe firſt Cauſes to be the Properties of one only Maker, I mean the moſt perfect <hi>Being.</hi> in philoſophizing it was natural firſt to conſider, whether the World had always exiſted, or whether it had been made? 'Tis a Queſtion which <hi>Clem. Rom.</hi> makes to himſelf (<hi>Recognit. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 27.) Some choſe to believe the World's Eternity, but they were but few, and they follow'd the Syſtem of <hi>Ocellus Lucanus.</hi> Other, who were wiſer and more enlighten'd, apprehended that it muſt have had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; and theſe laſt philoſophiz'd according to the Principles of <hi>Time is Lacrus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Queſtion was farther, to know how and by whom the World had been made? The whole Syſtem of the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enteſt Philoſophy run upon this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Philoſophers made their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries on it, and after Attention and Study, the moſt knowing among them heard the <hi>Voice of God,</hi> or the <hi>Voice of Nature,</hi> which taught them that the World was the Workmanſhip of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely <hi>good, all-wiſe,</hi> and <hi>omnipotent</hi> God. <hi>Plato</hi> was the firſt who brought this Syſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem to Perfection. <hi>Thales, Hermotimus</hi>

But then, after all, as they are three Perfections which are inſeparable from the Idea of the Creator, he often confounded their Operations. As then, theſe three Properties, <hi>Goodneſs, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> make up the whole Idea which we have of God, with reſpect to the Creation. It's not to be wonder'd that the ſoundeſt Philoſophy fix'd on theſe three firſt Cauſes, when 'twas ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Origin of the World, by ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying and contemplating on the World it ſelf. The <hi>inviſible Grandeurs of God,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 1.20. <hi>as well his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Power, as the other Attributes of his Godhead, become as 'twere viſible, in being clearly underſtood by his Works from the Creation of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis therefore certain, that 'twas by beholding theſe Works, that the Author of them was found out, and that it was diſcover'd that they were the effect of Infinite <hi>Goodneſs, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi> And they went no farther, becauſe the Syſtem of good Philoſophy, with reſpect to the Creation, proves compleat with theſe three Principles, as has been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaid. And indeed on the leaſt Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, in conſidering the Exiſtence of this Univerſe, its well contriv'd Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, its Parts ſo exactly adjuſted to each other, its admirable Order, its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Motion, its Vaſtneſs, Form, Laws and Proportions, its Corruptions and Produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, its Duration, Stability and Variety; and in a word, all the Wonders wherewith it is filled; one muſt neceſſarily conclude the Meditation, in confeſſing that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe <hi>Goodneſs</hi> gave Birth to the Deſign of it, that profound <hi>Wiſdom</hi> fram'd its Model and Figure, that Infinite <hi>Power</hi> executed ſo great a Project, and that theſe three Properties together preſerve it, and give Motion to all its Springs.</p>

                     </q> Good Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy went directly to a Trinity, which may be known by the Light of Nature. Some difference will be ſeen in the manner of expreſſing, but in the main 'tis always the ſame Truth.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:200403:13"/>to their diligent Search and Enquiry.

It is by their long Searches into the Origin of the World, and not by Tradition (at leaſt by a very uncertain and confus'd Tradition) that they attain'd to the Knowledg of theſe three Principles, <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi>

                  <p>THoſe are the inviſible Excellencies which are diſcover'd in the viſible Works of the Creation, and a natural Philoſophy, which does not depend on Tradition, but on Contemplation and Study. <hi>Socrates</hi> did not take any other Method to find the Truth, as <hi>Apuleus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates after <hi>Plato (de Deo Socratis)</hi>

                  <p>AFter this Digreſſion concerning the <hi>Demon</hi> of <hi>Socrates,</hi> we'll return to <hi>Plato.</hi> That Philoſopher had attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a perfect Knowledg of theſe three Principles, <hi>Goodneſs, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power;</hi> and underſtood thereby, 1. That the World was not Eternal and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbegotren;</hi> but that the ſupreme Father, thereto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined by a Diſpoſition of <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> had begotten it by his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and filled it with his <hi>Power:</hi> three Principles which he call'd the <hi>Good,</hi> the <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and the <hi>Soul</hi> of the World. 2. That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the World was not an effect of Chance, or of any blind Principle, but of a moſt <hi>good</hi> and moſt <hi>wiſe</hi> Cauſe, of an <hi>intelligent</hi> and <hi>rational</hi> Power.</p>
                  <p>The Author of the <hi>Recognitions, l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 19. informs us, that this was <hi>Plato</hi>'s meaning. For arguing againſt thoſe who attributed the World's Origin to the fortuitous jumbling together of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:200403:14"/>Atoms, he applies himſelf to prove that 'tis the effect of profound Wiſdom; and not forgetting one rational Property, comes thence to ſay, that 'tis the Work of Reaſon, which <hi>Reaſon,</hi> ſays he, I call the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>God.</hi> It is apparent that <hi>Plato</hi> had no other thought than that of this Author. Nevertheleſs, fearing <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>'s Fate, he veil'd theſe great Truths under a Cloud of Fictions and Enigma's, which prov'd a Snare to his Diſciples: and, not having Courage enough to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe common Error, made of theſe <hi>three Properties</hi> of the Creator, ſo many <hi>Gods,</hi> or Divine <hi>Perſons;</hi> complying with the Theology of that Age, wherein Powers, Paſſions, Properties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Fortune, Fate, Juſtice, Love, Vertue, Honour, Safety, Concord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were not otherwiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd than under the Idea of ſo many Deitys; ſo much was the Plurality of Gods the Philoſophy <hi>a la mode,</hi> even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Wiſeſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>It is difficult, ſaid <hi>Plato</hi> (<hi>apud Clem. Alex.

                     <q>I will ſpeak to you, ſays he, by <hi>Enigma,</hi> that if by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent this Letter happen to fall into other hands, he may not, in reading, underſtand it.</q>

                        <hi>Plato,</hi> ſays he, ſpake more clearly of God than any other Philoſopher; and his Doctrine would be perfectly Divine, if he had not ſpoil'd it by a mixture of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion eſtabliſh'd by the Laws of his Country.

He is Creator of the Soul, and of all things as well Celeſtial as Terreſtrial: But that Philoſopher does previouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe, that 'tis difficult to find him becauſe of his infinite Power; and that when he is found, it is impoſſible to explain one's ſelf concerning him to the common People.</q> Why im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible? Becauſe dangerous. Theſe few Words contain an Abridgment of our whole Syſtem: That <hi>Plato</hi> ſpake of God only with reſpect to the Creation: That he believ'd him to be the Father of the World, and conſequently that the World is his Son: That he knew him better than other Philoſophers: and that nevertheleſs he has ſpoil'd that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, by mixing with it the Errors of his Country, becauſe he thought it too dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to ſpeak his thoughts of it openly. That is, he had not liberty to ſpeak his Mind; and to pleaſe a ſuperſtitious Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulacy he was forc'd to make as many <hi>Hypoſtaſes</hi> and <hi>Gods,</hi> as he had diſcover'd Perfections in the World's Creator. In a word, to philoſophize on the Origin of the World ſecurely, he was oblig'd ſubtilly to feign a Genealogy of Gods, <hi>a Father, a Begotten Son, a third proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thoſe two,</hi> and to turn the whole <hi>Coſmogony</hi> into a mere <hi>Theogony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We know <hi>Proclus,</hi> one of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, maintain'd that his Maſter plac'd a Supreme God above this Trinity of Principles whereof we have been now ſpeaking; which plainly enough ſhews, that under theſe three feign'd <hi>Eſſences</hi> or <hi>Perſons</hi> he deſign'd to hide the ſeveral Perfections of the moſt High God, whom he believ'd to be but one Eſſence and one Perſon; but he multiply'd him after the manner of the Heathens, to ſhelter himſelf from the Rigour of the Laws.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be doubted but all the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers had the ſame aim of preſerving the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of God under a multitude of feign'd <hi>Perſonalities,</hi> without any danger to themſelves. Unleſs any will ſuppoſe it to have been a witty Invention, which they fram'd for the better inſtructing and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:200403:14"/>fixing the Minds of the common People, who are pleas'd with Wonders and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries. One may indeed believe that they did it with a good intention, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to place, inſtead of groſs Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm, the ſeveral Properties of the True and moſt High God; that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might inſenſibly receive an exchange which was ſo advantageous to them. And ſo much the worſe for Chriſtians, who have been bubl'd by this Eaſtern Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, in taking literally a Method which was merely Allegorical. I will conclude this Reflection on the three <hi>Platonick</hi> Principles with this Obſervation of <hi>Origen,</hi> agreeing with the Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul</hi> (<hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>contra Celſ.</hi>) <q>That Philoſophers having in the Creation of the World, beheld what is inviſible in God (which this Father calls the <hi>Divine Ideas</hi>) and being rais'd from ſenſible to Spiritual things, did plainly enough perceive his Eternal Power and Godhead.</q> But what are theſe inviſible Excellencies which appear in the Creation? They are the three Principles, whereof <hi>Plato</hi> was pleas'd to make three <hi>Hypoſtaſes</hi> or <hi>Perſons.</hi>

                  <p>But the beſt Interpreter of this <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick Trinity</hi> is <hi>Galen,</hi> in his third Book <hi>de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſu Partium;</hi> his Words are plain, and may be call'd the right Key of <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm.</hi>

For, in my opinion, that God has been pleas'd to fill the World with ſo many good things, is a Mark of his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> which deſerves our unmoſt Praiſe: That he has found the way of putting it into ſo good Order, is the higheſt pitch of <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> and that he could execute ſo vaſt a deſign, is the effect of Almighty <hi>Power.</hi>
                     </q> Nothing is plainer than this Comment: He fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains the Doctrine of the Three Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, without mixing any Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Subtleties, or Cabaliſtick Myſteries, with it.

                     </gap>, as <hi>Valentin</hi> calls them, <hi>apud Iren. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 5.) thoſe ſeveral Diſpenſations, which they conceiv'd in one and the ſame God. For they did conſider him, 1. without regard to the Creature, as incomprehenſible, and retir'd into a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Silence;</hi> that is, as not having yet ſpoken that efficacious <hi>Word</hi> which was to make the Creature: and then he call'd him the <hi>Profound</hi> and the <hi>Silence;</hi> that was the firſt Order of <hi>Aeons.</hi> 2. They conſider'd God with reſpect to the <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible</hi> World, as having his <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> fill'd with <hi>Ideas,</hi> Ideas being the Eſſence and the <hi>Truth</hi> of things, according to the <hi>Platoniſts:</hi> and then they call'd him the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> and the <hi>Truth;</hi> that was their ſecond <hi>Syzigy.</hi> 3. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd God with reſpect to the <hi>ſenſible</hi> World, as executing his Deſign, and ſpeaking that powerful <hi>Word,</hi> which gave Life and Being to all Creatures: and then they call'd him <hi>the Word</hi> and <hi>the Life,</hi> that was their third <hi>Syzigy.</hi> 4. They conſider'd God with reſpect to the <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Evangelical</hi> World, as working Redemption; and there they found the Mediator, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt Man,</hi> with the new <hi>Church,</hi> which he made by his Preaching and Death: and then they call'd him the <hi>Man,</hi> and the <hi>Church;</hi> that was their fourth Alliance. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, theſe ſeveral <hi>Emanations,</hi> rightly taken, are but the ſeveral Reſpects in which they conceived one and the ſame God, who having been hid in an Abyſs of Light, did outwardly manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in theſe two admirable Works of the Old and New Creation.</p>
                  <p>That is the Teſtimony which <hi>Irenaeus, l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 15. gives of them. <q>The <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinians,</hi> ſays he, after having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided their <hi>Emanations,</hi> did howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver return to the Unity, holding that all together made but one.</q> And in <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 6. the ſame Father's relating that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> gave the moſt High God two Wives, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:200403:15"/>they called the Father's two Powers, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently ſhews, that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> fell into <hi>Plato</hi>'s Allegory, in aſcribing <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> as two Properties inſeparable from one and the ſame Spirit, to the <hi>Good,</hi> or Creator of all things: And I don't ſee why <hi>Ptolomy</hi> might not as well Allegorically ſay, that the ſupreme Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had two Wives, as <hi>Philo,</hi> in the like caſe, that the World had <hi>God</hi> for its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and <hi>Knowledg</hi> for its Mother.</p>
                  <p>But if all theſe ſeveral <hi>Powers</hi> of the <hi>Valentinians</hi> did not deſtroy the Unity of God, whence then comes it, you'l ſay, that their Doctrine was ſo abhor'd? The reaſon is apparent, <hi>viz.</hi> That in avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Chriſtian Simplicity, they run the Faith into terrible Confuſion, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God's Unity to Peril by their idle Speculations.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Baſilidians,</hi> they did alſo allegorize on the word <hi>Abraxes,</hi> whereby they underſtood that Supreme Power from which all the other <hi>Aeons</hi> or Spirits proceeded. This Name has in its <hi>Greek</hi> Letters the Number 365, which is that of the Days of the Year, or, according to <hi>Baſilides,</hi> of the Celeſtial Orbs. And he intended to ſignify that <hi>Abraxas,</hi> or the moſt High God, was the Father of the Celeſtial Orbs, Ages, or <hi>Aeons,</hi> and Creator of the Univerſe. 'Tis probable that this is a <hi>Hebrew</hi> Word, and that it comes from <hi>Ab, Ben, Rouach, Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Spirit. Menage</hi> would, with his Etymological Sagacity, find no difficulty in proving this to be its Derivation; thus, <hi>Ab, Ben, Rouach, Abenrach, Abe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach, Abrach;</hi> and, adding a <hi>Greek</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, <hi>Abrachas, Abraxas. Serenus</hi> the Phyſician, of the Sect of the <hi>Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidians,</hi> lengthening the Word, fram'd <hi>Abracadabra</hi> of it; which is another myſterious Name, which he made uſe of as an <hi>Amulet,</hi> or Preſervative, for the Cure of all intermitting Fevers; almoſt as the Superſtitious uſe ſome Words of the beginning of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, which they hang about the Patient's Neck, as I my ſelf have ſeen. Now in as much as the <hi>Baſilidians</hi> paſs for the firſt Authors among Chriſtians of the Diſcipline of the <hi>Secret,</hi> and of the <hi>Platonick</hi> Trinity, it is very likely that they deſign'd to hide it under this Allegorical and Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Name. But it is alſo poſſible that this Name contains only the Goſpel-Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, whereon they allegoriz'd extravagantly, according to the Cuſtom of that Time.</p>
                  <p>By this Eſſay which we have been mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it ſufficiently appears, that we could give a rational Meaning to the other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the <hi>Aeons,</hi> wherewith the <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks</hi> did alſo enlarge their Syſtem. With a little labour in taking off the Veil of Allegory, which covers the hidden Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this myſterious Theology, one might eaſily enough diſcover, that the true aim of theſe Chriſtian Philoſophers was to ſet off the lowneſs of the Goſpel by the ſuppos'd depths of their Myſteries. But we'll go no farther on this Article: The Sample given is ſufficient.

Which yet has a good Senſe, according to <hi>Mark</hi> the <hi>Valentinian,</hi> who in Chap. 10. of the ſame Book ſays, <q>That God, to give a viſible Form to the inviſible Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures which are in him, utter'd his <hi>Word</hi> like himſelf.</q> Underſtanding by the <hi>Word</hi> only the viſible Form, which God takes to manifeſt himſelf in.

                  <p>This was the Opinion of the <hi>Sabellians,</hi> who by the <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not any way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand a <hi>Man,</hi> but only Divine Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and Heavenly Aid manifeſting it ſelf to Men in the Work of Redemption.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:200403:16"/>Names, nothing more is given us than a fair Syſtem of my Underſtanding, with its Reaſon and Ideas; or to ſpeak better, its univerſal and unchangeable Natures, which the Philoſophers call'd the Reality and Truth of things, and whereof they made even the Eſſence of God. Yea, I dare venture to ſay, that 'tis Deiſm or Atheiſm diſguis'd. The Accuſation is heinous, and requires Proofs of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt evidence. Well, and we ſhall produce them. Read and weigh theſe <hi>Words</hi> (<hi>ubi ſupra,</hi> p. 209.) that Author ſays, <q>The Idea of a Triangle has a determinate and immutable Nature, ſuch as it is not in my power to make the leaſt alteration in, —which is a certain Proof that it is not of my making, for then it would be arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and I might change it as I pleas'd; but that it is an abſolute Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, diſtinct from and independant of my Underſtanding: And to ſay the truth, it is nothing elſe than the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God himſelf modify'd, and as it is exhibitive and imitable in ſuch and ſuch a manner, ſince nothing is abſolutely immutable but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; he alone being that Father of Lights, in whom there is no ſhadow of turning.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is plain: The Idea of a <hi>Triangle</hi> is nothing elſe but the very Eſſence of God modify'd in ſuch a manner. Again, the Idea of an Owl is only this Divine Eſſence ſo modify'd; the Idea of a Lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is ſtill but a Modification of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence; in a word, the Idea of all Beings is nothing elſe than the very Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God modify'd in ſuch or ſuch a manner: <hi>Jupiter eſt quodcunque vides, quocunque moveris.</hi> What do you call that?

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:200403:17"/>in explaining the Scripture, but as an irreproachable Witneſs of Apoſtolical Tradition.</q> I confeſs bad Interpreters may be good Witneſſes of the Faith of their Age. But it muſt at the ſame time be granted me, that the Faith whereof they teſtify, is a too much ſuſpected Faith, when it depends on the Evidence of ſo bad Interpreters.

They give nothing but Allegorical Senſes to the Texts of the Holy Scripture; their Explications appear ſo very far diſtant from what the Sacred Writers meant, that one knows not where to begin, to diſintangle the true Doctrine of the Apoſtles, from the particular Speculations of the greateſt part of thoſe, to whom we are ſent as to ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reproachable Witneſſes of what was believ'd in their time.</q> If it be ſo, I don't ſee that <hi>Juſtin</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> can be better Interpreters of the Scripture than <hi>Origen</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtin:</hi> they were not leſs corrupted by Philoſophy, nor leſs confus'd and perplex'd; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they cannot be good Witneſſes of what was believ'd in their Time: For how is it poſſible to diſtinguiſh the ſound Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Apoſtles in their Writings from their <hi>Platonick</hi> Speculations?</p>

                  <p>Some may perhaps wonder, that they ſo diſpos'd their Deitys by Couples: They therein imitated the Heathens, who attributed both Sexes to each of their falſe Gods (<hi>Rep. des Lett.

                  <p>This is the Caſe: Some Philoſophers in endeavouring to avoid the Opinions of the <hi>Ebionites,</hi> thereby fell into ſo ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous an extreme, as to reject the God and the Meſſiah of the <hi>Jews:</hi> They ſpake ill of the God who had given the Law, and pretended (<hi>Irenaeus l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 25.) that the <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the Son of another ſuperiour God; and therefore apply'd themſelves to ſublime Generations of the Subſtance of the moſt High God, and to other ſuch extravagant Conceits: which the Orthodox greedily embracing out of hatred of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and of Judaizing Hereticks; at firſt they were only my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical ſenſes, to ſet off the Glory of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> but afterwards theſe meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical Generations degenerated to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Generations; and what had at firſt been conceiv'd only as Operations and Powers, was converted into <hi>Hypoſtaſes</hi> and Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Subſtances.</p>
                  <p>To conclude; as I make no difference between the <hi>Jewiſh Cabals,</hi> and the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian Pleroma;</hi> theſe two Syſtems are either equally ridiculous, if exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned according to the ſtrict literal ſenſe, or equally rational, if you ſeek in them the concealed ſenſe, which lies under the Bark of Allegory. For 'twas indeed the ſame Infatuation for Allegory, which drew the <hi>Jews</hi> as well as Chriſtian Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks into this Cabaliſtical Philoſophy,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:200403:18"/>the outſide whereof appears to us ſo very extravagant and whimſical. The one compos'd their <hi>Pleroma</hi> of certain Pairs of <hi>Aeons.</hi> The other do as much with their <hi>Sephiroth,</hi> or <hi>Enumerations,</hi> which they range by two and two. We cannot then ſay otherwiſe either of the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Valentinians,</hi> than that under theſe Theological Fictions, they deſign'd to conceal their true Doctrine concerning Coſmogony and the Origin of things. Thoſe <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Philoſophers never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that the World was made out of nothing: Creation out of nothing was then unheard of. As they held that all Subſtance that is in the World had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways exiſted, and that the firſt Cauſe included all other Natures, in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity of its own; they underſtood by their <hi>Sephiroth</hi> only the <hi>Emanations</hi> of all Beings from the ſubſtance of the ſupreme Being. And as <hi>Emanations</hi> are of two kinds, one of which reſpect the ſenſible World, and the other the intelligible; by the firſt they intended to expreſs only the ſeveral Forms of all Creatures, which are as ſo many Emanations from the firſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and by the other, they deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to repreſent the Ideas of the Divine Underſtanding, which are the Emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Eternal Wiſdom, which they call'd Exemplars, the Inſtruments and Means of the Creator's Power. So that one cannot doubt, but that with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Application, one might diſcover in the Cabaliſtick <hi>Emanations,</hi> either the diverſe Diſpenſations of Providence, or the eſſential Properties of the Creater; and particularly the three which gave birth to the <hi>Platonick Trinity, Goodneſs, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> which are in effect found among the ten Divine Names, whereof their <hi>Sephiroth</hi> are compos'd. For after all that has been ſaid, 'twere Obſtinacy not to own, That what's to be born with in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Cabal, and which is raſhly applied to the Chriſtian <hi>Trinity,</hi> is borrow'd from <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Coſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony,</hi> and taken from the grounds of the ſoundeſt and antienteſt Philoſophy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Origin of the World. So that one may, without fear of miſtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, aſſert that the Cabal is nothing elſe but a Mixture, which has been made of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Superſtitions with <hi>Platonick</hi> Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations. As to the reſt, conſiſting in the Science or Myſtery of Numbers, of Points, Syllables and <hi>Letters,</hi> which they pretend to have taken from certain Books aſcrib'd to <hi>Eſdras;</hi> it's what we call the Viſions and Dreams of thoſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IX. Plato</hi>'s Syſtem explain'd.</head>
                  <p>I Return to the Syſtem of <hi>Plato,</hi> which I ſhall endeavour to unfold. That Philoſopher admitted of three ſorts of Divine <hi>Eſſences,</hi> which he call'd <hi>three Principles</hi> or <hi>three Gods.</hi> The firſt is the <hi>Supreme God,</hi> to whom the two others owe Honour and Obedience, becauſe he is their Father and their Creator. The ſecond is the <hi>viſible God,</hi> Miniſter of the inviſible, and Creator of the World. The third is called the <hi>World,</hi> or the <hi>Soul</hi> which animates the World, to whom ſome give the Name of <hi>Demon.</hi> To return to the ſecond, which he alſo ram'd the <hi>Word, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> or <hi>Reaſon;</hi> he conceiv'd two ſorts of <hi>Words,</hi> one which dwelt in God from all Eternity, whereby God did from all Eternity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe all ſorts of Virtues in his Boſom, doing all things with <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> with <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and with <hi>Goodneſs:</hi> For being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely perfect, he hath, in this <hi>internal Word,</hi> all the Ideas, and Forms of created Beings. The other <hi>Word,</hi> which is the <hi>external</hi> and <hi>uttered Word,</hi> is, according to him, nothing elſe than that Subſtance which God put forth from his Boſom, or which he <hi>begat</hi> to frame the Univerſe by it. It is in this reſpect that <hi>Mercurius Triſmegiſtus</hi> ſaid that the World is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantial</hi> with God. And it is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> tho a Chriſtian, ſays of Matter, what the other Fathers have ſaid of the <hi>Word</hi> only, <q>That God utter'd it, and put it forth.</q> (<hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 29.) He followed the above-noted Principles of <hi>Plato.</hi> Bp <hi>Huet</hi> aſcribes the ſame Opinion to <hi>Origen</hi> (<hi>Origen. Quaeſt.</hi> 2.) That the Matter which God made uſe of to form the World by, was from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity emanated from his own Subſtance.</p>
                  <p>Many of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Diſciples having em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd Chriſtianity, they fail'd not to attribute to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> all that this Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy attributed to the <hi>ſecond God,</hi> and particularly the Creation of the <hi>World,</hi> maintaining that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was this <hi>ſecond Nature</hi> of their Divine <hi>Plato,</hi> who had exiſted before the Creature, and had received order from his Father to produce it from Nothing: That this <hi>Word</hi> had ſince appear'd to the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> as the Miniſter of the moſt High God; and that at laſt having aſſum'd a Body in the Womb of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> he had preached the Goſpel to Men. They thought they ſhould thereby infinitely raiſe the Honour of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and draw the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> the more eaſily to the Chriſtian Religion: Beſides that, 'twould have been grievous to them, that, after having ſtudied ſo long, and made ſo fine a Figure in <hi>Plato</hi>'s School, it ſhould be ſaid that they had ſtudied in vain.</p>
                  <p>'Tis eaſy producing Proofs of this from both Philoſophers and Chriſtians. As to the former, one need but read <hi>Timaeus Locrus,</hi> from whence <hi>Plato</hi> had his Doctrine. That antient <hi>Philoſopher (De Anima Mundi)</hi> firſt ſuppoſes a moſt good <hi>Principle,</hi> whom he calls <hi>God:</hi> Then he diſtinguiſhes three Orders of Things, 1. The <hi>Idea</hi> or Form, which is eternal in God, and which is the <hi>perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:200403:19"/>Pattern</hi> of all things begotten, and liable to change: That's the firſt <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>intelligible Word.</hi> 2. <hi>Matter,</hi> whereby he underſtands that Subſtance which God put forth out of himſelf, deſtitute of Form, which others have called the <hi>ſecond Word,</hi> or the <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd Word.</hi> 3. Having conſider'd the <hi>Idea</hi> as the <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Matter</hi> as the <hi>Mother,</hi> he holds, that of theſe two Principles a third is fram'd, who is their <hi>Son,</hi> which he calls the <hi>Senſible,</hi> or the <hi>ſenſible World,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from the <hi>intelligible,</hi> and which others have call'd the Soul (or Spirit) which animates the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Order</hi> of Nature. Thence he concludes that there is but one World, that this World is the <hi>only Son of God</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>The Author of <hi>Mercurius Triſmegiſtus</hi> ſo exactly ſutes his Language to that of theſe Philoſophers, that one cannot in the leaſt doubt but that he deſigns to ſpeak of the <hi>World</hi> under the Name of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> which he gives it. <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſuffer'd himſelf to be deceiv'd by it, according to the good Cuſtom of the Fathers, who apply'd every thing to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> greedily receiving what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſeem'd to favour their <hi>Platoniz'd</hi> Chriſtianity. This is the Paſſage, ſuch as it is, in that Father (<hi>Divin. Inſtit. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 6.) <q>The Lord, ſays <hi>Mercurius,</hi> and the Creator of all things, whom we call <hi>God,</hi> becauſe he has made a ſecond <hi>viſible and ſenſible God;</hi> this Lord, I ſay, having made this the firſt and the only one, he appear'd to him beautiful, and full of all ſorts of good things, and he ſanctified him, and loved him as his <hi>only Son.</hi>

                  <p>Now it is apparent that theſe Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers ſpake thus of the <hi>World,</hi> becauſe they believ'd it created, in oppoſition to the Opinion of <hi>Occllus Lucanus,</hi> who indeed holds, in his Book <hi>de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>) meaning that it is eternal, and that it never was created. Thence it is that thoſe who follow'd the other Opinion, held that there was none but God who was unbegotten (<hi>ingenitus,</hi>

                     </gap>) that as to the <hi>World,</hi> it was <hi>begotten,</hi> being the <hi>only Son</hi> of God. Hence came that famous diſtinction of the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> between the <hi>ingenitus</hi> and the <hi>genitus;</hi> having apply'd to the <hi>Father,</hi> and to the <hi>Son,</hi> what the Philoſophers had ſaid of <hi>God</hi> and of the <hi>World,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not apprehend this Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical Philoſophy, and had not read this Leſſon of <hi>Phurnutus,</hi> (<hi>ubi ſupra Cap.</hi> 35.) <hi>That the Antients ſubtily Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophiz'd on the Nature of the World by Symbols and Enigma's.

                     <hi>Apuleius</hi> is another of thoſe who very well underſtood <hi>Plato</hi>'s Doctrine. <q>
                        <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> ſays he, <hi>(De Dogmate Platonis)</hi> ſuppoſes three Principles of all things,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:200403:20"/>
                        <hi>God, Matter,</hi> and <hi>Forms,</hi> which he calls <hi>Ideas: God</hi> incorporeal and inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable, who is the Creator and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Matter</hi> increatable, incorruptible and infinite, which is neither corporeal nor incorporeal; and <hi>Ideas,</hi> that is to ſay, the Forms of things, which are ſimple, eternal, and incorporeal.</q> Then he makes him divide into three Orders, what he calls the firſt Subſtances, viz. <hi>God, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> and the <hi>Soul.</hi> Laſtly he obſerves that <hi>Plato</hi> ſometimes aſſerts, that the World is without Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and ſometimes that it had an Origin, and was <hi>begotten.</hi> Which does not imply any Contradiction, the <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Platonick World</hi> being eternal, but the <hi>ſenſible</hi> and <hi>corporeal World</hi> having been begotten.</p>
                  <p>It is the ſame with the <hi>Word:</hi> Some have ſaid it was eternal, having taken its Eternity from the <hi>intelligible</hi> and <hi>ideal World:</hi> Others ſuppos'd, <hi>that there had been a time wherein it was not;</hi> tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its beginning from the Origin of the viſible World.

So true it is that the Syſtem of the <hi>Word</hi> was made by the Model of the Syſtem of the <hi>World.</hi> As to the World, this is the Obſervation of <hi>Curio</hi> (in fol. 35, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of his <hi>Araneus:</hi>) <q>If all things are eternal, the Opinion of the <hi>Peripatetics</hi> concerning the World's Eternity proves true: —For ſince God created the World, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtrange or unexpected can hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to him, what Inconvenience is there in ſaying, that what was made in time was in him before all time? God is of himſelf: The Beings which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <hi>Ideas,</hi> and we call Forms, are ſo in God, that they are nothing in themſelves. — Now before the World was made, it was nothing in it ſelf, but in God, in that vaſt Nature, in that <hi>ideal</hi> Model, where all things <hi>always</hi> have been, and <hi>always</hi> are — The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of this Univerſe not being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from the immenſe and eternal Wiſdom of God.—To conclude, after the World was made, it had a double Exiſtence, one it ſelf, with reſpect to all things exiſting in time; another in God, becauſe nothing can exiſt out of his Eternity and Wiſdom.</q> All which does in all reſpects agree with the <hi>Word:</hi> Before it was begotten or utter'd, it was nothing in it ſelf, it had no <hi>Hypoſtaſis,</hi> it ſubſiſted only in God, in the Idea of that vaſt Nature in which all things have been from all Eternity: But after it was put forth, it had a double Being (or Exiſtence) the one in God, as he is himſelf the Model and Archetype of all things which exiſt; the other in it ſelf, as it is the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> of all Creatures. Whence it appears, that the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Athanaſians</hi> deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other in ſo brutal a manner as they did, was from a mere Miſtake.</p>

                  <p>But when <hi>Philo</hi> ſometimes gives the Name of <hi>God</hi> to the <hi>Soul of the World,</hi> he underſtands by the <hi>Soul of the World</hi> no more, as <hi>Cudworth</hi> hath own'd, than the <hi>Word</hi> it ſelf, or the <hi>ſecond God,</hi> to whom he might give different Names, according to the diverſity of Notions that he form'd, either of God, or of the <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> or <hi>Power,</hi> &amp;c. But however it be, 'tis always whilſt he conſiders the thing in God, and never out of God, nor in the created World. In this ſame Senſe St. <hi>John</hi> ſaid, that the <hi>Word</hi> that made all things, was in God, and that the <hi>Life</hi> or the <hi>Soul</hi> was in that <hi>Word,</hi> not diſtinguiſhing at all the <hi>Soul</hi> from the <hi>Word,</hi> as the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> did.</p>
                  <p>You may judg by this whether Mr. <hi>Le Clerc</hi> had good ground to quote <hi>Philo</hi> in his Paraphraſe upon St. <hi>John,</hi> as one of thoſe who were not ignorant of the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Three</hi> in the Deity. <hi>Philo</hi> having ſaid firſt, That in the literal Senſe, the three Men that appear'd to <hi>Abraham</hi> were three Angels, he afterwards goes on to the <hi>hidden</hi> and <hi>allegorick Senſe;</hi> where he ſaith, that it is God accompany'd by his two <hi>Powers,</hi> whereof the one is that <hi>Power</hi> that created the World, the other that Wiſdom which conducts and governs it. <q>God, ſaith he, between theſe two Powers preſents to an enlighten'd Soul ſometimes one <hi>Image</hi> only, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times three: For our Soul ſeeth but one Image, when being purified by Contemplation, ſhe raiſeth her ſelf above all Numbers, and advanceth to that pure and ſimple Idea, which is one, and independent of all others. On the contrary, the Soul conſiders three of them, when not being as yet initiated in the Myſteries of the firſt Order, ſhe ſtops at the ſmaller; <hi>viz.</hi> when not being capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending him who is conſider'd in himſelf, and without any foreign Aid, ſhe ſeeks him in his ſeveral Relations of Creator and King.</q> The Myſtery of Three then, according to him, is for low Souls, who are not capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending God in his Unity, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of all Creature, and that ſeek him in the Works of Creation and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. But the great Myſtery of puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Souls, is to raiſe themſelves, by a Contemplation tranſcending all Creatures, towards that only and ſimple Idea that hath nothing common with the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly he pretends that there is a third Senſe, differing from that of the <hi>Contemplation,</hi> which he ſeems beſides to call the Letter of the Scripture, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which, 'tis <hi>he who is</hi> with his two Powers. But this laſt cannot be the <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral</hi> Senſe, ſeeing it would be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to ſay, that in the <hi>literal</hi> Senſe they were three Angels; and yet in the ſame Senſe it was <hi>he who is</hi> with his two Powers. Beſides, that by this means he would confound this laſt Senſe with the ſecond, which yet he diſtinguiſheth carefully. We ought then to ſay, that this laſt Senſe, if we would diſtinguiſh it well from the other two, muſt be the Senſe of the <hi>Oeconomy.</hi> That is to ſay,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:200403:21"/>that they are indeed three Angels, but that the firſt of them bears the Name of <hi>Jehova,</hi> and repreſents his Perſon. It is for this reaſon he aſſures, that this Senſe is agreeable to the Scriptures account, becauſe it is the ordinary Stile of the Scripture, to give the Name of <hi>Jehova</hi> to that Angel in whom God hath put his Name. That Senſe is not the <hi>literal</hi> one, which owns but three Angels only as to their Nature; nor the <hi>ſublime</hi> Senſe, that finds there God himſelf with his ſundry Relations of a <hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>King:</hi> But it is an <hi>Oeconomical</hi> Senſe, which makes the firſt (who is but an Angel by his Nature) to be <hi>Jehova</hi> in reſpect to his Office, becauſe he bears the Name of <hi>Jehova,</hi> and ſpeaks by his Authority. Whereas the other two Angels are not conſider'd here but as two Powers of the Supreme God; that is to ſay, as Miniſters of him who repreſents <hi>Jehova.</hi> And as ſuch they are ſent to deſtroy <hi>Sodom,</hi> this Execution being beneath the Majeſty of the firſt.</p>
                  <p>We need conſult only <hi>Philo</hi> himſelf, to know what he underſtands by theſe Divine Powers, and to be convinc'd that he intends no Nicety whilſt he makes them to be two or three; but follows the Text herein, which ſpeaks here of three Angels. Elſewhere he reckons a greater Number of 'em: For in two other Books of his <hi>(de Opificio &amp; de Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugis)</hi> he gives us clearly to underſtand, that by the Powers wherewith God is accompanied, he means only Angels, ſeeing he makes them ſhare the Creation of Man with the Supreme God; for this reaſon, becauſe the Supreme God would not be the Author of what is evil in Man. He therefore left to the Angels the care of making the mortal part of his Soul, which is ſubject to Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; reſerving to himſelf alone the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior part, where Reaſon hath Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. It was in this ſenſe, according to him, that God ſpake in the Plural, <hi>Let <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s make Man according to our Image.</hi> You according to the Image of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in making him capable of Evil; but I according to the Image of the Deity, in making him capable of Good. And for the ſame reaſon he attributes ſometimes the Creation of the World to this firſt Angel, whom he calls the <hi>Word,</hi> or the <hi>Son of God,</hi> ſuppoſing always that this Work, how excellent ſoever in it ſelf, yet was beneath the Divine Majeſty, and that God could not put his hand to it without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring his Greatneſs. Could ſo able a Philoſopher as <hi>Philo</hi> be capable of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Task, which he thought unworthy of God, to Powers which he thought to be equal to, and of the ſame Nature with him?</p>
                  <p>Now to return to the Text we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, let us ſay that they are three An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in the <hi>literal</hi> Senſe; and that in the two other Senſes, it is <hi>he who is</hi> with his two Powers; But we muſt take heed of a double meaning in the ſecond Senſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the <hi>Allegory, he who is with his two Powers,</hi> denotes <hi>God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with his ſundry Operations:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the third Senſe, which is the <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomical</hi> one, the ſame-Terms ſignify only <hi>him who bears the Name of God with two other Angels, that ſerve him as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</hi> Thus you ſee the three Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of <hi>Philo</hi> explain'd, the which it ſeems Mr. <hi>Le Clerc</hi> underſtood not. The firſt hath nothing that is <hi>Platonical,</hi> but is purely an Hiſtorical Senſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that three Angels in a Human Shape preſented themſelves to <hi>Abraham.</hi> The third hath nothing of <hi>Platoniſm</hi> neither, it is a <hi>Theological</hi> Senſe, to wit, the Senſe of all the <hi>Jews,</hi> and of all the Chriſtians, who underſtand the antient Diſpenſation. The 2d that remains, is not <hi>Platonical</hi> neither, if you take it with <hi>Philo, alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorically;</hi> that is, in an arbitrary Senſe, wherein the Letter of the Scripture is rais'd to Speculations and Ideas, that have no Foundation, or any reality in the Text. This laſt Interpretation of <hi>Philo</hi> would be truly <hi>Platonical,</hi> if he underſtood by the Three he ſpeaks of, either three <hi>Hypoſtaſes,</hi> or three diſtinct
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:200403:22"/>
                     <hi>Perſons,</hi> whereas he underſtands there but one only <hi>Perſon</hi> under three different reſpects, to wit, God conſider'd either in himſelf, <hi>he who is;</hi> or in relation to us, inaſmuch as he is our <hi>Creator</hi> and our <hi>King.</hi> This is what <hi>Philo</hi> calls <hi>the Jehova with his two Powers.</hi> One might indeed call this a <hi>Platonical</hi> Senſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided <hi>Plato</hi> be underſtood as he ought, who under the <hi>Allegory</hi> of three Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſes, deſign'd to inform us of nothing elſe, but only an All-good, All-wiſe, and All-powerful God, both in the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and the Government of the World. But then the Authority of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Philo,</hi> who are quoted as having ſpoken of <hi>three Diſtinctions</hi> in the Deity, will become uſeleſs to the Trinitarians.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>He is in the right: For where is that Unitarian, I pray you, who owns not an <hi>internal Word,</hi> and an <hi>eternal Reaſon,</hi> which always ſubſiſted in God, and which is God himſelf (as Mr. <hi>Le Clerc</hi> expreſſeth it in his Paraphraſe) which alſo dwelt in J.

And by the Word, ſaith he, <hi>Paul</hi> did not intend that <hi>Hypoſtaſis,</hi> which we call the <hi>Son of God,</hi> but a <hi>Power,</hi> and a Divine Virtue, which form'd him in the Virgin, and which was cloſely united to him to work the Miracles he did.</q> Neither can it be denied that this was the Opinion of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryllus.</hi> Thoſe Expreſſions of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> that have given ſo much trouble to the Learned, are not difficult to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, provided you ſupply them with ſome Particle, and add a word or two, as you muſt ſometimes in all other Authors. In my opinion <hi>Euſebius</hi> intends nothing elſe (<hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 33.) but that this Biſhop maintain'd that the Man J. C. did not pre-exiſt in another <hi>Eſſence,</hi> or another Nature, that was proper to him, before he liv'd among Men: And conſequently that the Deity which dwelt ſince he liv'd among Men, was not an <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> of his own, but the Divinity and Virtue of the Father. This is a right Notion; the <hi>Word</hi> is nothing elſe but a Divine Power diſtinct from the <hi>Son,</hi> and a Heavenly <hi>Wiſdom</hi> deſcended on J. C. <hi>Beryilus, Paul,</hi> and <hi>Marcellus</hi> had it perhaps from <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who calls J. C. <hi>(Epiſt. ad Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſ.) The Eternal Word that came not forth out of ſilence; i. e.</hi> that he was not a <hi>Word brought forth</hi> and <hi>be otten</hi> with its proper <hi>Hypoſtaſis,</hi> but the <hi>Operation</hi> and the eſſential <hi>Virtue</hi> of God manifeſting himſelf outwardly. For I frankly agree, that this Paſſage of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> which hath given ſo much trouble to the Abettors of his Epiſtles, is not intended againſt <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine;</hi> but I ſay, it attacks thoſe <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick</hi> Doctors, who aſſerted a <hi>Generation</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> a little before the Beginning of the World, and who believ'd that it was <hi>brought forth,</hi> and conſequently <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded out of Silence.</hi> This was the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and many of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who preceded him, that the <hi>Word that was brought forth,</hi> which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd to be the only that was <hi>begotten,</hi> and the only one that might be call'd the <hi>Son,</hi> did come forth in time of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>mute Word,</hi> which they call'd <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> or <hi>Wiſdom</hi> eternal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tertullian</hi> teacheth us poſitively <hi>(adv. Prax.)</hi> 
                     <q>that before the <hi>Word that was brought forth,</hi> came out of the <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> or the Divine Reaſon, God had it in himſelf, in his Thought, as a <hi>ſilent Word; habebat intra ſemetipſum tacitè cogitando.</hi>
                     </q> You cannot expreſs more clearly, that the <hi>Word brought forth</hi> came out of Silence. This Opinion, no doubt, began to glide in at the time of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who laughs at it, and refutes it, rejecting this <hi>Word brought forth,</hi> and <hi>proceeding</hi> out of Silence, which receiv'd its <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> a little before the Creation, as being a <hi>Word</hi> merely <hi>Flatonick;</hi> and he admits no other <hi>Word</hi> to be real, but that eſſential Virtue, which was eternally in God, which is God himſelf, which cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the World, and was as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated in J. C. And this <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s way of ſpeaking, that J.

C. in ſuch a manner, that you may ſay rightly, that J. C. made the Ages by his Power, and conſequently by himſelf; for that which is done by my Power, is done by my ſelf. When therefore the Apoſtles ſay, <hi>that all things <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:200403:23"/>meaning is no other, but that they were made by the immenſe Power of the Father, which was in J.C. he becoming that <hi>Power,</hi> that <hi>Spirit,</hi> that <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> becauſe all the Miracles effected by that Power, are ſaid to be done by J. C. in whom it reſided. In this ſenſe <hi>Simon Magus</hi> call'd himſelf, <hi>the great Power of God,</hi> and boaſted that he had made the Ages; not that he believ'd himſelf, as the Antients would have it, to be a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Hypoſtaſis,</hi> ſometimes the <hi>Father,</hi> ſometimes the <hi>Son,</hi> and ſometimes the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> He was not ſo extravagant, but only aping J.

J. C. is in the ſame ſenſe call'd the <hi>Power of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.24.</p>
                  <p>We may enforce the Explication we have given of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Words, by the manner how <hi>Irenaeus</hi> diſputes againſt the <hi>Valentinians</hi> (<hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 47. <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>) <q>It is true, ſaith he, that in regard to Man, he is ſometimes ſilent, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſpeaks; ſometimes he takes his reſt, and ſometimes acts: But it is not ſo with God, who being all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, all Reaſon, all Spirit, is not liable to ſuch like Changes.</q> Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that God is always a <hi>Reaſon,</hi> an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Word,</hi> but never a <hi>Word brought faith,</hi> as he explains himſelf afterwards, ſaying. <q>That God being all <hi>Reaſon, thinking</hi> in him is <hi>ſpeaking,</hi> and <hi>ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> nothing elſe but <hi>thinking:</hi> For his <hi>Thought</hi> is his <hi>Speech,</hi> and his <hi>Speech</hi> is his <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding;</hi> and this <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> which comprehends all things, is the Father himſelf.</q> Further, to make us the better comprehend, that he ſpeaks thus againſt the <hi>Word brought forth,</hi> or begotten, he accoſts the <hi>Valentinians</hi> with this ſmart Raillery. The <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> ſaith he, ſpeak of the <hi>bringing forth</hi> and <hi>Generation</hi> of the Son, as if they had aſſiſted the <hi>Father</hi> at his Birth.

                     <q>The Ideas are about the <hi>Good,</hi> the <hi>Angelic Spirits</hi> about the <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and the <hi>Forms</hi> about the <hi>Soul of the World.</hi> He adds, that <hi>Plato</hi> calls them <hi>three Principles,</hi> not becauſe they are equally ſuch, but inaſmuch as they are
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:200403:23"/>ſubordinate the one to the other. The <hi>Good</hi> is ſuch of <hi>himſelf;</hi> the <hi>Reaſon</hi> inaſmuch as it is the <hi>neareſt to God,</hi> and the Soul inaſmuch as it is <hi>produced by the firſt and ſecond God.</hi>
                     </q> Now this Order, whatever it be, hath no relation at all to an <hi>inviſible Trinity,</hi> but is manifeſtly refer'd to the World and Creation, ſeeing the <hi>Second</hi> and the <hi>Third God</hi> are nothing elſe but the <hi>

I am not ignorant that <hi>Clemens Alexandr.</hi> pretends in the ſame Book I have quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that theſe Words of <hi>Plato</hi> mean nothing elſe but the <hi>Chriſtian Platonic</hi> Trinity (if I may expreſs my ſelf thus) but without any ground, as is evident by the Commentary of <hi>Ficinus. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> endeavours to ſhew in this whole Book, that there is no Tenent in the whole Chriſtian Religion, but what is found in <hi>Plato</hi> and the other Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Deſiderius Herauldus,</hi> as he is quoted by Monſ. <hi>Le Clerc,</hi> (<hi>Biblioth. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niv. Tom.

This Critick having related a Paſſage of <hi>Cyril</hi> againſt <hi>Julian,</hi> where this Father pretends that <hi>Plato,</hi> aſcribing the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World to the <hi>Word,</hi> ſpeaks the ſame with St. <hi>John;</hi> that Critick declares that himſelf is not at all of that Opinion: <q>You have here the Word, ſaith he (<hi>Exercit. in Baron. pag.</hi> 5.) by the which <hi>Plato</hi> aſſures the viſible World was made. He indeed ſeems to ſay what St. <hi>John</hi> did, which is what <hi>Cyril</hi> pretends to: but if we take a nearer view of this Affair, this <hi>Word,</hi> or this <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as <hi>Plato</hi> would have it, which the ſupreme God em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Creation of the World, is viſibly and wholly different from the <hi>Word Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whereof St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks; which <hi>Word</hi> is unknown to thoſe, to whom the Revelation is known. There are found many ſuch like Expreſſions in the Fathers, where the Ambiguity of the Words may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thoſe, who do not examine them with a requiſite Attention.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>See here in brief what may be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> Writings of the Platonic Philoſophers.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Philoſophers conſidering the <hi>Trinity,</hi> always with reſpect to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, built three Syſtems thereon. We ſhall name the firſt a <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologic Syſtem,</hi> which puts down the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being for the <hi>firſt God,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible and Ideal World for the <hi>ſecond,</hi> and the ſenſible World for the <hi>third:</hi> The firſt is the Father, becauſe he is the Underſtanding generating the Ideas; the other is the Son, the <hi>internal Word</hi> or the <hi>Thought</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> becauſe he is immediately generated, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:200403:24"/>always in the Ideas of the <hi>Father:</hi> the laſt is the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Soul,</hi> or the Creature proceeding from the other two, becauſe it receives the <hi>Form</hi> from the <hi>Idea,</hi> but its Life and its Motion from the firſt Author of all things. I ſhall name the ſecond Syſtem of the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> the <hi>Ailegoric Syſtem,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders a Trinity of Properties in the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> God or the <hi>Word,</hi> in relation to the Creation; meaning by the <hi>Divine Word</hi> nothing elſe but the infinite <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> the admirable <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and the immenſe <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> which have form'd the Univerſe, as we have obſerved it above in a Paſſage of <hi>Clemens.</hi> Hence it appears on what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they called it the <hi>Maker</hi> and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all things. Laſtly, we will name the third the <hi>Phyſical Syſtem,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders in relation to the World an <hi>effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cauſe, viz.</hi> a Creator and a Father, a <hi>Matter</hi> ſubſiſting from all Eternity in this firſt Author, which proceeded from him, by the way of <hi>Prolation</hi> or <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> and a <hi>Form</hi> produced, reſulting from the other two, both from the <hi>Matter</hi> and the <hi>firſt Cauſe.</hi> The one is the <hi>internal Word,</hi> the other the <hi>Word brought forth,</hi> and the third is the <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated World.</hi> Theſe three Syſtems (and perhaps many others, that may be found in the allegorizing Platoniſts pregnant with ſuch like Methods) are the Cauſe of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Doctrine being ſo conſus'd, and difficult to be penetrated. Therefore Mr. <hi>le Clerc</hi> was in the right, when he ſays (<hi>Biblioth. univ. Tom. X. p.</hi> 396.) <q>That there is a great deal of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> Syſtem, that they have even contradicted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, not having a clear and diſtinct Idea of what they would ſay.</q> We may affirm the ſame of the antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who follow'd this Philoſophy, in relation <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> But he did not obſerved <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> remarkable hereof proceeds not only from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of their Syſtems, but alſo for want of a good diſtinction between the <hi>ſubtil Platoniſm</hi> (for ſo I ſhall call it) which treated allegorically of the <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of God, under a Figure of <hi>three Gods</hi> who created the World; and the <hi>groſs Platoniſm,</hi> which perceiving not the ſubtil part of this Allegory, and following the Letter, made three Hypoſtaſes of theſe three <hi>Powers.</hi> The firſt Method being allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric and arbitrary, might (without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting it ſelf) change the Name, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Number, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Figures it made uſe of, to expreſs always the ſame thing. This was an ingenious Invention, that varied its Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Reſemblances, tho it continued the ſame at the bottom. But the ſecond Method, fix'd on the Number Three, which were always reckoned in the ſame Order, and had almoſt always the ſame Names given them, could not be liable to the ſame Confuſion, eſpecially among Chriſtians, who applied it conſtantly to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they could explain themſelves clearly in this laſt Method, and ſpeak of it diſtinctly; whereas the other, in its very riſe, was a politick Method pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially invented, and which was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood either ill or not at all, becauſe it kept ſecret and allegorical.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, the ſame diſtinction of <hi>groſs</hi> and <hi>ſubtil Platoniſm,</hi> ought to take place in reference to the other two Syſtems, <hi>viz.</hi> in relation to the <hi>Creator, Matter</hi> and <hi>Form;</hi> and with reſpect to the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>intelligible World,</hi> and the <hi>ſenſible</hi> World. If you diſtinguiſh not well between the <hi>Allegory</hi> and the <hi>Letter,</hi> nothing will prove more intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate or unintelligible. Laſtly, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Cauſe of this Confuſion is, theſe two Methods being ſo often inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix'd; for if you mind it, the Fathers ſometime philoſophizing according to the <hi>ſpurious Platoniſm,</hi> inſiſt rigidly on the ſenſe of the three <hi>Hypoſtaſes:</hi> and ſometimes treading in the Footſteps of the true and antient Platoniſm, do only allegorize, and by their <hi>Emanations</hi> ſeem rather to mean the <hi>Powers</hi> of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:200403:24"/>Being, than <hi>Spirits</hi> ſubſiſting. Sometimes nothing will ſerve their turn, but <hi>Subſiſtences, Subſtances,</hi> a true <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> and a real <hi>Proceſſion:</hi> At other times 'tis a quite different thing, they mean only the Powers and different <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomies</hi> of God, manifeſting himſelf in the Creation of the World; to which they ſeem to give improperly the Name of a <hi>generated Son</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom brought forth;</hi> which doubtleſs is the Cauſe why ſo much Sabellianiſm overſpreads their Writings.

                     </gap>. The Fathers in like manner diſtinguiſh'd the two <hi>Words,</hi> whereof the one is <hi>internal,</hi> the other <hi>brought forth;</hi> and conſider'd only the ſecond as a <hi>Son,</hi> becauſe properly ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they called Generation only that which was perform'd at the beginning of the World. They ſay, <q>When God wil'ed to create the World, <hi>he brought forth or generated the Word.</hi>
                     </q> May you not eaſily perceive, that ſuch Modes of Speech owe their riſe to the <hi>Myſtic Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,</hi> which conſider'd the whole World as the Son of God, and as a <hi>Son</hi> generated by his <hi>Word</hi> or Command? Yes, theſe Turns of Expreſſion owe their birth to ſome Poetical ones of the Heathens, like thoſe of <hi>Orpheus</hi> related by <hi>Juſtin (in Protrep. ad Gentil.)</hi> 
                     <q>I ſwear, ſaith the Poet, by that Voice which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father uttered, when he form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the whole Creation.</q> Then it was, according to <hi>Juſtin,</hi> that God <hi>generated</hi> his <hi>Word,</hi> becauſe he brought it forth in order to create the World.</p>
                  <p>All this is well meant, and grounded upon the Words of <hi>Moſes.</hi> The only difference I remark in the Syſtem about theſe two <hi>Words</hi> is; ſeeing Allegory is arbitrary, ſome have fix'd it on the <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible World,</hi> which they made to be the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as many of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers we quoted have done; becauſe they conſider'd it as the <hi>Production</hi> of the Divine <hi>Speech</hi> or <hi>Power:</hi> but others fixed their Allegory upon the <hi>intelligible</hi> or <hi>Ideal World,</hi> even on the <hi>Speech</hi> it ſelf as <hi>thruſt</hi> forth, which they conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a Production of the <hi>Divine <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:200403:25"/>This laſt Syſtem was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Chriſtians, when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonalized either the <hi>Word brought forth,</hi> as the firſt Fathers and the <hi>Arians,</hi> or the <hi>Internal</hi> and <hi>Mental Word,</hi> as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> and the <hi>Athanaſians</hi> did.</p>

                  <p>All theſe Fathers generally tell us, that before the <hi>Word</hi> was <hi>generated,</hi> it was in the <hi>Heart</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> in the <hi>Womb</hi> of his <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> in his <hi>Bowels,</hi> whence it came forth as it were from its <hi>Seed</hi> and <hi>Bud.</hi> Either all theſe Terms mean no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or they denote that the Son did not then exiſt, otherwiſe than in the <hi>Deſign</hi> and <hi>Intent</hi> of the <hi>Father;</hi> that he came forth thence, when by the virtue of the Divine <hi>Prolation,</hi> he did receive a real Exiſtence. Now it is not the firſt Exiſtence but the ſecond, which the Fathers conſtantly and properly call the <hi>Generation</hi> of the Son, or in other words the <hi>perfect Generation,</hi> i. e. the real and actual Generation. Monſ. <hi>Du Pin</hi> (<hi>Bibl. Tom.</hi> 1. at the Word <hi>Theophilus</hi>) ſaith, <q>That the Fathers affirm the <hi>Logos</hi> to be Eternal, and that it was in God from all Eternity, as his <hi>Counſel,</hi> his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and his <hi>Word.</hi>
                     </q> But they ſay the ſame <hi>Word</hi> which was in God, did after ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner come out of God, when God reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ereate the World, becauſe he then began to make uſe of that Word in order to act outwardly: This is what they term to be the <hi>Proceſſion, Prolation,</hi> and even the <hi>Generation</hi> of the <hi>Word.</hi> This hinders not indeed the Word's having been from all Eternity, nor its eternal <hi>Generation</hi> of the Father, as we conceive the manner thereof, <hi>but this is not what they call Generation.</hi> The ſame Author owns in his Notes upon the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that this Father means not <hi>Generation</hi> to be the eternal <hi>Proceſſion</hi> of the <hi>Son,</hi> but only a certain <hi>Prolation</hi> or outward <hi>Emiſſion,</hi> conceiv'd by him to have been at the Creation of the World, becauſe God both created and governs it by the <hi>Word.</hi> He ſaith further, we need not wonder, that he ſhould tell us in his Book againſt <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenes,</hi> that there was a time when
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:200403:25"/>the <hi>Father</hi> was not <hi>Father,</hi> and that the <hi>Son</hi> began to be <hi>Son,</hi> becauſe he believ'd that the <hi>Son</hi> had neither that Quality nor Name, but only when the Word was created.</p>
                  <p>Monſ. <hi>Jurieu</hi> expreſſeth himſelf as fully in his ſixth Paſtoral Letter of the third Year, attributing this Sentiment to all the <hi>Antenicene</hi> Fathers, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Word</hi> had not its perfect <hi>Birth</hi> before the World's beginning; <hi>i.e.</hi> according to Mr. <hi>Jurieu,</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> is not eternal as it is a <hi>Son,</hi> but only was hid in the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of his Word</hi> as Wiſdom; and that he was as it were produc'd, and <hi>became a diſtinct Perſon</hi> from that of the Father, a little before the Creation. You muſt be wilfully blind, if you perceive not from what ſource this <hi>Theology of the Word</hi> doth ſpring. As it is certain that the Heathens ever philoſophiz'd of their Gods, but relatively to the Origin of this Univerſe, and have always join'd <hi>Theogony</hi> with their <hi>Coſmogony:</hi> So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe theſe <hi>Platonizing</hi> Chriſtians follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Steps of this Pagan Philoſophy; their Creation of the World always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying the <hi>Prolation of the Word,</hi> or the <hi>Generation of the Son.</hi> This is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ſame Monſ. <hi>Jurieu</hi> in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foremention'd Paſſage, when he ſpeaks of <hi>Athenagoras</hi> and <hi>Tertullian.</hi> 
                     <q>They believed, ſaith he, that the <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which was not the Son of God at firſt, but only in a <hi>Bud</hi> or <hi>Seed,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpread it ſelf over the <hi>Chaos,</hi> did not only generate the Creatures, but did alſo as it were by the ſame Effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, give a <hi>perfect</hi> exiſtence to the <hi>Word,</hi> or to the <hi>ſecond Perſon</hi> of the Deity.</q> This indeed may be ſaid to philoſophize like Heathens. May it not be ſaid, that the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and the <hi>Chaos</hi> were the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mother,</hi> whoſe Children are the <hi>Word</hi> and the <hi>Creatures?</hi> But this is not all, they bring them in by Couples like the <hi>Aeons</hi> of <hi>Valentine;</hi> ſo true it is that the Chriſtians would not divide, what the Philoſophers and Poets had united ſo cloſely, <hi>viz. Theogo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> and <hi>Coſmogony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I return to Dr. <hi>Bull,</hi> praying him to conſider whether a real Generation, and properly ſo called, can be expreſſed better than by ſaying that it is <hi>perfect,</hi> that it is <hi>in Act,</hi> that it gave a <hi>perfect Exiſtence to the Word,</hi> that it made the <hi>Word</hi> a <hi>Perſon diſtinct from the Father;</hi> and in ſhort, that it render'd the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> to be properly a <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> properly a <hi>Son.</hi> This the Fathers ſay of the <hi>ſecond Generation,</hi> which they conſider as the <hi>only Generation</hi> and <hi>Birth</hi> of the <hi>Son.</hi> On the contrary, can an <hi>improper</hi> and <hi>Metaphoric Generation</hi> be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed berter, than by ſaying, that the Son exiſted only in <hi>Idea potentrally,</hi> in a <hi>Bud,</hi> in its <hi>Seed,</hi> in the <hi>Heart,</hi> in the <hi>Womb</hi> and the <hi>Bowels</hi> of God? For thus the Fathers talk of the <hi>firſt Generation,</hi> or to expreſs it better, of the <hi>firſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence</hi> of the Son of God, which they ſcarce reckon to be a Generation. For can you, for example-ſake, call the <hi>Metaphoric</hi> Exiſtence of <hi>Levi</hi> in the Loins of his Father, when he was deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in <hi>Abraham,</hi> a <hi>Generation?</hi> But the Fathers think thus of the firſt <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> whilſt they ſay that the Son exiſted then only in a <hi>Bud</hi> or <hi>Seed,</hi> and not, as Monſ. <hi>Jurieu</hi> pretends (<hi>Tabl. du Socin. Let.</hi> 6. <hi>Art.</hi> 3.) that he was contain'd in the Boſom of the Father, as a Child is in its Mother's Womb; as if the <hi>Word</hi> had need to form it ſelf by degrees in the <hi>Bowels</hi> of the Father, and wait its time, to wit, that of the Creation of the World, which ſhould likewiſe happen to be that of its Delivery. If Mr. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieu</hi> had underſtood the <hi>Platonic</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, he had taken care to avoid ſuch a ridiculens Thought.</p>

                  <p>THE antient Doctors followed <hi>Plato,</hi> and their meaning was, that the Divine Underſtanding is the Principle and <hi>Bud,</hi> where the Son exiſted from Eternity <hi>as to his Eſſence:</hi> all Eſſences being eternal in this reſpect, according to the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> becauſe they are the <hi>Emanations</hi> of the Subſtance of God, but particularly all <hi>generated Spirits;</hi> hence <hi>Homouſianiſm</hi> takes its riſe. The <hi>Son</hi> came forth out of this firſt ſource of all Eſſences, being the chiefeſt of them in God's Deſign. He came forth in Time <hi>as to his Perſon,</hi> to be the firſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Father in the Creation of this Univerſe: This diſtinguiſheth him from all the Creatures, the Birth of which is leſs noble, as not being <hi>immediate.</hi> Hereupon, if you had asked them the reaſon, why the <hi>Word</hi> alone, amongſt all the <hi>generated Spirits,</hi> ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Son,</hi> or the <hi>only Son,</hi> they could not have alledged any other than the Privilege of being <hi>generated immediately</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) of the Father; whereas the other Spirits were ſo, by the means of a ſecond God and Miniſter. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Apoſtolic Conſtitutions</hi> ſpeaks thus (<hi>Lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 12.) <q>The Father, who alone is above all Generation and Beginning, having created all things by his only Son, has immediately <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated</hi> (without any Intermedium) that his only Son by his <hi>Will,</hi> by his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs:</hi> He generated him before all the Aeons, making uſe of him afterwards to create even the Aeons, the Cherubims and Seraphims, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> According to him the Angels were form'd by the <hi>Son,</hi> but the Son was generated only by the <hi>Will</hi> and the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Power</hi> of God, which is his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative.</p>
                  <p>You need not doubt that <hi>Euſebius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the ſame thing, when he calls J. C. (<hi>de Laud. Conſtan. cap.</hi> 1.) <hi>the moſt antient of all the Aeons,</hi>

                     </gap>. Other Fathers thought the ſame, whenever they made uſe of theſe Words of St. <hi>John, In the beginning was the Word;</hi> for they did not mean that by the <hi>Beginning Eternity</hi> ought to be underſtood, which this Word cannot denote, as <hi>Maldonat</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth ingenuouſly (<hi>in Joan.</hi> 1.1.) they only meant, that the <hi>Word</hi> was not crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the beginning of all things (when God created the Heavens and the Earth) after the manner of other Creatures, or that of the other <hi>generated Spirits,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>it had a Being then already,</hi> the Father having begotten it before by an <hi>immediate</hi> Generation. For this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Author of the <hi>Recognitions</hi> (<hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.) denies formally, that the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> may be called <hi>Son,</hi> 
                     <q>becauſe there is, ſaith he, but one <hi>ungenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> and but one <hi>generated;</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid that the Holy Spirit is a Son, having been made by another, who was likewiſe made.</q> 
                     <hi>Euſebius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers this Doctrine as a<note n="*" place="margin">Such is the Argument of that Chapter.</note> 
                     <hi>Tradition of the Church</hi> (<hi>De Eccleſ.

                     <hi>Origen</hi>'s Doctrine is the ſource of all this, who maintains in his 1 <hi>Tom.</hi> upon St. <hi>John,</hi> that the Holy Spirit is a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Son, relying with <hi>Euſebius</hi> upon this Expreſſion, that all <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

You may join <hi>Zeno</hi> of <hi>Verona</hi> with him (<hi>de aeterna Filii Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, Serm.</hi> 3.) who moreover explains this Generation, by referring it to the Creation of the World. <q>For, as he ſaith, it was then that the Word, which was as it were buried in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſs of the Divine Underſtanding (<hi>in profundo ſacrae Mentis, Serm.</hi> 1.) was <hi>thruſt forth</hi> and <hi>begotten.</hi>
                     </q> Would <hi>Valentine</hi> have expreſſed himſelf other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe about his <hi>Word,</hi> which came forth out of the Underſtanding, than this Man doth of his, come out of the <hi>Deep</hi> and <hi>Silence?</hi> But we ought not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get <hi>Rupert,</hi> who unfolds admirably this Philoſophic <hi>Cabala,</hi> ſaying, <q>That the Father <hi>actually</hi> begot the Word, which contain'd <hi>potentially</hi> all things, when he created the Heavens and the Earth. Yes, he goes on, the Father thruſt forth this <hi>good Word</hi> out of his Heart, and before the Morning-Star begot him out of his Boſom, <hi>viz.</hi> out of the Bottom of his Subſtance, when he ſaid,</q> 
                     <hi>Let there be Light.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more like to <hi>Origen</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <q>That the Generation of the Light,</q> is the <hi>Generation</hi> of the <hi>Son.</hi> Mr. <hi>Huel</hi> excuſeth <hi>Origen,</hi> alledging that he ſpoke allegorically: we do not doubt it, all this Theology is Allegorick. The <hi>Word</hi> or Command which God utter'd to the Creature, is the <hi>Son</hi> of God, but improperly ſo, and in the ſame ſenſe, that my <hi>Thought</hi> or my <hi>Speech</hi> are the Sons of my Underſtanding, which both conceives and brings them forth: This is too evident, and for this Cauſe Dr. <hi>Ball</hi> had reaſon to retrench out of his Quotation (<hi>Deſen. Fidei Nic. p.</hi> 395.) theſe laſt Words of <hi>Rupert</hi>'s Paſſage; <q>
                        <hi>That the Father beget the Son, when he <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Lactartius</hi> goes beyond all theſe Doctors I quoted; for he allows not to the Word ſo much as the Advantage of an immediate <hi>Generation,</hi> above the other <hi>generated Spirits:</hi> He finds no difference between them, but only in the different manner of their <hi>Prolation,</hi> and in the different Deſign God had in the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them. <q>The Holy Scriptures teach us, ſaith he (<hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 8.) that the Son of God is the <hi>Word of God,</hi> even as alſo the other Angels are the Spirits of God. For the <hi>Word</hi> is a Spirit, which was brought forth with a ſignificative Voice: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Spirit</hi> (Breath) and <hi>Speech,</hi> are thruſt forth by different Organs, the Spirit proceeding out of the Noſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trils, and the Speech out of the Mouth, conſequently there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between this <hi>Son of God</hi> and the other Angels <hi>(caeteros Angelos)</hi> theſe being come forth out of God as <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> and <hi>mute</hi> Spirits, becauſe they were not created to preach the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of God, but only for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of his Orders. But the Son, notwithſtanding he is a Spirit, yet he came forth of the Mouth of God with a Sound and a Voice, like unto Speech, becauſe God was to make uſe of his Voice to inſtruct the People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> You ſee manifeſtly, how he confounds the Angel, who is called the Word, with the other Angels; that he makes them all to proceed out of God equally by an <hi>immediate Prolation;</hi> and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:200403:27"/>that the only difference he makes here conſiſts in this, that the common An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels proceeded out of the <hi>Noſtrils</hi> of God as <hi>mute</hi> Spirits, deſign'd only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute his Orders by Deeds; whereas this chief Angel whom he calls the <hi>Son,</hi> doth proceed out of the Mouth of God, as a vocal and ſounding Speech, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to deliver his Oracles, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal his Will.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Origen,</hi> or ſome body elſe under his Name, goes beyond even <hi>Lactantius</hi> himſelf, in that he confounds the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> with that of common Creatures (<hi>Homil.</hi> 2. <hi>in diverſos</hi>) For tho on the one hand he ſeems to ſay, <q>That the Word was born before all things, and that all things were made by him;</q> yet he advanceth at the ſame time, that theſe Words, <hi>all things were made by him,</hi> ſignify only, that at his being born of the Father, all things were likewiſe born together with him, the <hi>Generation</hi> of the <hi>Word-God</hi> being the ſame with the Creation of all things. And tho he ſaith, <q>That the Son is of a different Subſtance from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he hath the ſame Nature with the Father, and that he had a beginning before Time was:</q> He ſeems to deſtroy all this, by adding, <q>That the Subſtance of the <hi>Father</hi> is the Cauſe of the <hi>Son's</hi> Subſtance, and that Jeſus Chriſt intended ſo much when he ſaid, that his Father was greater than he;</q> which aſſerts evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that the Subſtance of the <hi>Father</hi> is greater than that of the <hi>Son:</hi> As alſo when he goes on, <q>To exiſt before Time, is to exiſt not in Time, but with Time.</q> His Concluſion will tell us his Meaning: <q>We ought then, ſaith he, to believe three things, the Father bringing forth the Son begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and the things that were made by the <hi>Word;</hi> the Father ſpeaks, the Word is begotten, and all things are made.</q> Conformably to what he was ſaying, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Father bringeth forth the Word, that is to ſay, beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Wiſdom, all things were then made. It is not difficult to ſound the Depth of this Philoſophy. The <hi>Word</hi> is of the ſame Subſtance with the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> becauſe it is the proper <hi>Power</hi> of the Father: but it is leſs than the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe it is only a Breath, an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manation, and a Ray. The <hi>Word</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things, becauſe it was neceſſary that God ſhould command before the Creature obeyed. But all things are born together with it, becauſe God cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the World, by bringing forth and begetting the <hi>Word.</hi> We ſhould open our Eyes, and ſee the Cabala of the Creation of the World through all theſe myſterious Generations. So, as <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> expounds it in brief (<hi>Strom. lib.</hi> 5.) <q>The <hi>Word,</hi> ſaith he, coming out of God did cauſe the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;</q> that is, to ſpeak plainly, God created the World by one ſingle Word; and ſeeing this great Maker made no uſe of any other Inſtrument, hence it came to paſs, no doubt, that this <hi>Word</hi> of his was called his Miniſter.</p>
                  <p>But let us return to <hi>immediate Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</hi> As the Philoſophers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by Wiſdom, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, nothing elſe but the Univerſal Idea of the World, which they called the <hi>firſt-born Son</hi> of God, becauſe it is the Plan of this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible World: So the Fathers being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nur'd to this way of philoſophizing, conceiv'd alſo the Idea of the Meſſiah, to be the firſt Idea in the Spiritual World, and an Univerſal One, and to be the Source and Seed of all the other Ideas. In this ſenſe <hi>Tertullian</hi> againſt <hi>Hermogenes,</hi> makes <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to be more antient than the <hi>Word,</hi> meaning that this <hi>Wiſdom</hi> did thruſt the <hi>Word</hi> it ſelf out of the Heart of God, and together all the various Forms of exiſting things. Which is a mere Allegory; the meaning of which is, that the <hi>Word brought forth,</hi> and all other things were made accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Plan</hi> and <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>internal Word,</hi> which is the immediate Produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Divine Underſtanding.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:200403:27"/>Hence it comes, that <hi>Juſtin</hi> in his ſecond <hi>Apology,</hi> diſtinguiſheth the Univerſal Reaſon (<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.)</p>
                  <p>The Philoſophers conſider'd theſe Seeds (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) 1. In God, and then they differ not from <hi>Platonic</hi> Ideas, which are not only the Forms of Creatures trac'd in the Divine Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but alſo are the Cauſes and the Origin of all Productions. <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> made uſe of this Word in that ſenſe, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. §. 10. 2. They conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red theſe Seeds in things created, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to denote by them their Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Forms, but eſpecially that of Man, who is as it were a Portion of the Wiſdom of God. This laſt is the ſenſe of <hi>Juſtin.</hi> But they diſtinguiſh'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe Primitive Seeds, the Idea of the Meſſiah, as an immediate one, and the firſt in the Divine Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the ſake of which God trac'd and form'd all the reſt. Hence aroſe that common Opinion, that God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the World for the Meſſiah. This Opinion, whether true or falſe, gave occaſion to <hi>Mahomet</hi> to apply to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf this Prerogative of the Meſſiah, that God would not have created the Heaven and the Earth, had it not been for the Love he bare him <hi>(apud Barthol. Edeſſen. in confut. Agaren.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Furthermore, if any will demand how it happened, that ſo many of the Diſciples of <hi>Plato,</hi> both Chriſtians and Pagans, did ſo groſly follow the Letter of his three Principles, made three <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſes</hi> of them, and changed his <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogony</hi> into a mere <hi>Theogony:</hi> I anſwer, as Monſ. <hi>Le Clerc</hi> doth concerning Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry (on <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.4.) <q>It proceeded, ſaith he, from the Craft of Prieſts; who, in order to make Religion more Auguſt, talk'd but very obſcurely of its Myſteries; whatever was clear was not convenient for them, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing muſt be concealed under Symbols and Riddles: and ſeeing that Symbolical Religion was purely arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it came to paſs that the true ſenſe of thoſe Symbols was effaced out of the Minds of Men, nothing remaining for the Vulgar, except what made an Impreſſion upon their ſenſes: So that they believed at laſt, that the Deity it ſelf dwelt under thoſe Figures. At firſt they deſign'd to repreſent under the Symbolical Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of an Ox, only a King devoted to Husbandry; but at laſt they came to believe, that the Soul it ſelf of that King deified did inhabit that Ox.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>No doubt but the Philoſophers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were a part of the People. The ſhrewder of them having found the Truth, had ſome Reaſons to cover it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Fictions, thereby to diſguiſe it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Plato</hi> had his, as we have ſeen already. He having found the Father of the World, to be the moſt good, wiſe and powerful God, and having found it dangerous to ſpeak of him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Truth, he made three <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſes,</hi> and three Gods of the three At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, which he conceived were in the Creator; and ſpake of them Majeſtically, under the Names of <hi>Good, Reaſon,</hi> and the <hi>Soul of the World,</hi> or under ſome other Fictions that vary the Terms, yet without altering the ſecret Doctrine contained in thoſe Symbols.

                     <q>
                        <hi>Arg. ver.</hi> 21, 22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> —This is expreſſed in ſuch mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Language, that tho <hi>Solomon</hi> I ſuppoſe thought of nothing but the wiſe Directions God had given them in his Word, revealed to them by his Servant <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; yet the antient Chriſtians thought his Words might be better applied to the Wiſdom revealed unto us in the Goſpel by the Son of God himſelf, the Eternal Word and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Father.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Could he have expreſſed himſelf more clearly, to give us to underſtand, that when the <hi>Platonic</hi> Fathers applied theſe loſty Expreſſions of <hi>Solomon</hi> to their <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> they did not, or could not do it, but by the way of an <hi>Accommodation</hi> or <hi>Alluſion?</hi> The ſame Biſhop, having related the Opinion of ſome Fathers a little lower, who apply the ſame Expreſſions of <hi>Solomon</hi> to the Man Jeſus Chriſt, afterwards goes on thus, <hi>pag.</hi> 63. <q>But this (ſaith he) not being the ſenſe of the Words which <hi>Solomon</hi> firſt intended, I ſhall not build my Paraphraſe upon it, but take <hi>Wiſdom</hi> here, as it ſignifies in other Places of this Book, and hath been hitherto deſcribed, whom <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> now celebrates for her moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Antiquity, and introduces like a moſt beautiful Perſon, no leſs than a Queen, or rather ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Being (infinitely to be preferred before that baſe Strumpet, ſpoken of in the foregoing Chapter.)</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed <hi>Solomon</hi> hath made her ſpeak, by introducing her as a Perſon, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borts young People to give ear to her: She ſpeaks of herſelf, that <hi>God created</hi> her, or that ſhe <hi>comes to us from God;</hi> that ſhe <hi>was before the World was made,</hi> becauſe God, who is the ſource of her and communicates her to Men, did make uſe of her in framing this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; Alſo that <hi>Kings reign by her,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Prudence and good Counſels are the Soul of a good Government. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this clear and natural ſenſe, Prejudice hath abuſed theſe Words to apply them to Jeſus Chriſt: but there are many other that cannot at all agree to him.</p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:200403:28"/>
                  <p>'Tis true, that the <hi>Platonick</hi> Fathers are alledg'd here, who underſtood this Chapter literally of a <hi>Perſonal Wiſdom.</hi> I own it, but the ſame Fathers have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and that with no leſs Pomp, quoted that Paſſage of the <hi>45th</hi> Pſalm, <hi>My Heart is inditing a good Matter,</hi> (Word) to prove the Eternal Generation of J.

We juſtly laugh now adays at ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous an Interpretation, as well as of that, Pſal. 110. <hi>From the Womb of the Morning thou haſt the Dew of thy Youth:</hi> Which the antient Interpreters did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make ſubſervient to the ſame purpoſe. Let us then, I pray, miſtruſt them as to this Text in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> they having ſo groſly deceiv'd us in thoſe two of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> which they made uſe of, for the ſame ends, as frequently and with as much Confidence.</p>
                  <p>But after all, tho their Teſtimonies ſhould be produc'd in ſhoals, we can produce better Interpreters of <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. I mean, the Books of the Old Teſtament it ſelf, the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiſticus,</hi> which tho they are Apocryphal, yet are of greater Authority than the Writings of the Fathers, who were the Diſciples of <hi>Plato;</hi> the Authors of theſe two having probably known better the Mind of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the Sentiments of the <hi>Jews.</hi> The Author of the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made uſe of the ſame <hi>Proſopopeia</hi> with him in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> calls Wiſdom, <hi>The Breath</hi> (Spirit) <hi>of the Power of God, a pure Stream flowing from the Glory of the Almighty, the Brightneſs of the everlaſting Light, the unſpotted Mirrour of the Power of God, the Image of his Goodneſs, and that ſhe ſits on the Throne of God.</hi> He goes on like the Author of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> that when God created the World, <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was with him, knew his Works, was preſent then, knoweth and underſtandeth all things.</hi> But to let you ſee that he ſpeaks only of a <hi>Quality</hi> or <hi>Virtue,</hi> he adds, <hi>That he loved her, ſought her out from his Youth, deſired to have her for a Spouſe, was a Lover of her Beauty.</hi> He deſires of God in his ardent Prayers, <hi>to give her to him, to ſend her out of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens to aſſiſt him, to teach him, that his Works might be acceptable: For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we hardly gueſs aright at things that are upon the Earth; but the things that are in Heaven who can ſearch out, unleſs God gives Wiſdom, and ſend his Holy Spirit from above?</hi> (See Chap. 7, 8, &amp; 9.) The ſame Author, ſpeaking further of this Divine Perfection, ſaith, <hi>That God made all things by his Word, form'd Man by his Wiſdom,</hi> Chap. 9. 1, 2. taking the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> for one and the ſame thing, <hi>viz.</hi> for that Power which created the World, and whereof Wiſdom is but an Emanation. Can you imagine now this Author meant, that God did create the World by his <hi>Son,</hi> the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity? Can ſuch a Thought en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a rational Creature?</p>
                  <p>Let us come now to the Author of the <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> who expreſſeth better the Senſe we ought to give to the Words of <hi>Solomon.</hi> He introduceth <hi>Wiſdom</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus of her ſelf: <hi>I came out of the Mouth of the moſt High; he created me from the beginning, before the World.</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto he ſeems to ſpeak of a Perſon, but explains himſelf clearly, Ch. 24. Ver. 23. where he declares that he meant by this nothing elſe but the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> name <hi>Wiſdom</hi> by way of Excellency. For having ſpoken of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> under other Figures than that of a <hi>Perſon;</hi> I mean, under the Figure of a <hi>Palm-tree,</hi> an <hi>Olive-tree,</hi> a <hi>Vine,</hi> &amp;c he ſums up what he had ſaid in theſe words: <hi>All theſe things are the Book of the Covenant of the moſt High, even the Law which</hi> Moſes <hi>gave.</hi> Can the Law given by <hi>Moſes</hi> be call'd more expreſly, not only an <hi>Olive-tree,</hi> or a <hi>Vine,</hi> but alſo the <hi>Word which came out of the Mouth of the moſt High, and Wiſdom which God created before the World?</hi> Which are Expreſſions viſibly figurative, the which under the Fiction of a Perſon, or the Figure of a Vine, repreſent the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God to us, ſometimes as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing it ſelf in the Creation of the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:200403:29"/>World, and again as repleniſhing Men with the Fruits of its Knowledg in the Diſpenſation of the Law. This kind of Fictions was familiar to the Moraliſt <hi>Jews,</hi> and to all the Oriental Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. You muſt be purblind, if you diſcern not immediately the Genius of that People, accuſtom'd to a figurative and parabolick Stile.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>John</hi> imitates the Moraliſt <hi>Jews;</hi> and, according to the ſame Ideas, hath at one view repreſented to us the <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God manifeſting himſelf to Men, in two of the greateſt of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Old</hi> and the <hi>New Creation.</hi> The Method is the ſame abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely; you need only put the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or the <hi>Author of the Goſpel,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Law.</hi> You may really ſee him join theſe two things together, <hi>viz. The Wiſdom of God reſiding in God himſelf, and preſiding at the Creation of the World; and the ſame Wiſdom deſcending upon J. C.</hi> (in whom it was as it were incarnated) <hi>and ordering the New World.</hi> For if, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the Law was the <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> or the <hi>Word,</hi> or <hi>Precept</hi> by way of Excellency; much more doth this great Elogium belong to the Goſpel, namely, to be the <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> the <hi>Truth,</hi> the <hi>Light,</hi> and the <hi>Life</hi> by way of excellency. An Elogium conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently belonging to J. C. who brought the <hi>Word</hi> and the <hi>Life,</hi> and was the great Teacher of <hi>Truth.</hi> Whatever the Scripture ſaith of the Firſt Creation, it ſaith the ſame in the ſame words of the New. All the <hi>Encomiums</hi> it gives to the Law, are applied more truly to the Goſpel; and laſtly, it ſaith nothing of God the Father, which it doth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate to J. C. his Son, <q>who is the <hi>Vicarius</hi> of the Father, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls him, and who, ſaith he, makes us to hear the Father in his Words, and makes us ſee him in his Actions.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this Rule you get the Key to all the Paſſages that ſeem to give the Son the ſame Names, Prerogatives, and the ſame Properties that God the Father hath; it is becauſe J. C. being the <hi>Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> of God, both the Words and Actions of the Father are attributed to him, by the virtue and upon the account of the <hi>Reprejentation,</hi> if I may thus expreſs my ſelf: For it is not, as I judg, by a mere <hi>Accommodation,</hi> but by a Subordination. Whatever is ſaid of the Father in an exact and rigid Senſe, may alſo be ſaid of the <hi>Son,</hi> as of a <hi>Miniſter</hi> and <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> that repreſents God; or to ſpeak better, that executes in a viſible manner what the Inviſible Father had already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd ſhould be done. Now leſt any one ſhould wrangle about this Title of <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> I ſhall ſay more, namely, that there is more than a <hi>Subordination,</hi> becauſe we ſee in J. C. not only the Character of an Envoy, but likewiſe an <hi>Abode,</hi> and an immediate <hi>Preſence</hi> of the <hi>Father's</hi> Perſon. He that receives a Prophet, receives him who ſends the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: therefore when J. C. came, veſted with the Authority of the Father, to accompliſh what God had promis'd ſhould be perform'd by the hands of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> God himſelf came in his Perſon, and we have receiv'd him in the Perſon of Chriſt. Hence it comes to paſs that J. C. is adorn'd with all the Characters of Glory and Power, which God attributes to himſelf, when he promiſeth that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Deliverance by the Prophets, which he deſign'd to perform one day for the good of his Church. For this reaſon J. C. is call'd <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> God with us, which is a Symbolical Name, by which the Scripture denotes the <hi>extraordinary</hi> Preſence of God in the Meſſiah, and teaches us, that it is not ſo much the Man, but that it is the Sovereign and Inviable God that acts. <hi>I ſpeak not of my ſelf, I ſpeak only the things my Father taught me; I do nothing of my ſelf, but the Father that dwelleth in me he doth the Works.</hi> Theſe, in one word, are the conſtant Expreſſions of J. C. he refers all the Authority of his Doctrine, and all the Glory of his Miracles, to the Father dwelling in him. This the <hi>Jews</hi>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:200403:29"/>call'd <hi>Shekinah,</hi> the <hi>Habitation of God.</hi> Here is more than the Abode of God in the midſt of his People of old; this is a more ſenſible and magnificent Preſence; and to ſay all, 'tis God's dwelling in the Meſſiah, for <hi>God was with him,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>You have need only of this Reflection to foil the ſtrongeſt Objection of the <hi>Trinitarians.</hi> They ſay, that the New Teſtament attributes conſtantly the ſame Properties and the ſame Perfections to the Son, and to the Holy Ghoſt, which the whole Scripture attributes to God the <hi>Father.</hi> Granted; What follows then? Neceſſarily one of theſe two things: Either you prove by it that there are three Gods, all which have the ſame Properties and equal Perfections; which is contradictory, and diſown'd even by thoſe that make this Objection: or you muſt acknowledg with us, that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Son are nothing elſe but the Perfections of the Father dwelling in him, and communicating himſelf to him. And the Holy Ghoſt is likewiſe only the <hi>Virtue</hi> and Power of God.</p>
                  <p>It is objected againſt this Doctrine I am now eſtabliſhing, that it is not cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary to call the Ambaſſador by the Name of the King that ſends him. I will not enter now upon the Particulars of this Controverſy, nor even examine the Hiſtory of the Centurion, related by St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> Chap. 8. and by St. <hi>Luke,</hi> Chap. 7. which alone were ſufficient to decide it. It will be enough for me to remark at preſent, that tho this Cuſtom were not us'd by Men in their Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, yet it is inconteſtably ſo in God's Method. <hi>Druſius (De Nomin. Tetragram. in Epiſt. ad Conrad. Vorſtium)</hi> grants that it may be ſaid, the King doth what the Ambaſſador tranſacts in his Name; but he denies at the ſame time, that you may give to the Envoy the Name of the King that ſends him: And thereupon he will not receive, without ſome alloy, that Rule of the <hi>Hebrews, That the Angel bears the Name of God who ſends him.</hi> But with all the reſpect I owe this Great Man, I affirm that this Rule of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> is well grounded, it being taken from the Scripture it ſelf, where God declares that he will put his Name on the Angel whom he deſign'd to ſend. It is no matter then whether this be the Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of Kings, or no; ſeeing it is clear by this Place, that it is the Cuſtom of God to give <hi>his Name</hi> to his Envoys, at leaſt on ſome occaſions, and in extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Caſes. And this Name, that I may take notice of it by the by, doth not denote only, that they may call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>the Lord, the Jehova;</hi> but indeed they have all the Glory, the whole Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and all the Power; yet not abſolutely, but only in reference to that Commiſſion they are then honoured with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al: that is to ſay, they appear with as much Majeſty, they act with as much Authority and Power, as God would in the like caſe, were he pleas'd to act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Medium, and by himſelf alone. And this is a great reaſon why God ſhould act thus; for ſeeing he could not manifeſt himſelf, if the Angels, by whom he was manifeſted, had never taken his Name upon them, it would have come to paſs that the <hi>Jews,</hi> having the knowledg only of Angels, would have totally forgotten God; whereas the Angels, by taking the Name of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them on ſome extraordinary occaſions, put that People from time to time in mind of him, by the Idea of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. After all, ſeeing God is inviſible by his Nature, and cannot manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by himſelf; it follows then, that every time he manifeſts himſelf by an Angel, this Manifeſtation will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as an Appearance of an Angel, but as that of God himſelf, whom that Angel repreſents: and conſequently, it is not ſo much the Angel that bears the Name of <hi>Jehova,</hi> and is ador'd by Men, but God himſelf, that Angel being his Perſon and Preſence. This will be clear, if you regard theſe three Rules. 1. That according to the Oriental Idiom, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:200403:30"/>make their Maſters ſpeak always di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly; as for example, inſtead of ſaying, <hi>The Lord ſaith he is the Jehova,</hi> they ſpeak thus, <hi>The Lord ſaith, I am the Jehova.</hi> 2. They ſuppreſs often theſe Expreſſions, <hi>The Lord ſaith,</hi> and ſpeak abſolutely, without making uſe of that Preface, <hi>I am the Jehova.</hi> 3. That you ought to ſupply thoſe Words, and read, <hi>The Lord ſaith, I am the Jehova;</hi> and then the Expreſſion will become ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as not at all to be myſterious.</p>

                     <hi>Phur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutus</hi> calls him an <hi>Angel</hi> or Meſſenger. <hi>Heraclides Ponticus</hi> gives the Name of <hi>Angel</hi> to <hi>Iris,</hi> and the Name of <hi>Word</hi> to <hi>Mercury:</hi> Sometimes he joins the Term <hi>Word</hi> with that of an <hi>Interpreter,</hi> calling <hi>Mercury,</hi> the <hi>Word Interpreter</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.) He alſo obſerves that <hi>Iris</hi> was thus call'd, becauſe ſhe brings word (as it were <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.) At laſt he gives the reaſon why Wings are aſcrib'd to him, becauſe, ſaith he, there is nothing ſo ſwift as Speech; which made <hi>Homer</hi> ſay, that Words had Wings. Hence it comes, no doubt, that we give Wings to <hi>Angels,</hi> as well as to <hi>Mercury,</hi> becauſe they are the <hi>Meſſengers</hi> and the <hi>Interpreters</hi> of God, <gap reason="foreign">

Seeing then the Heathens talk'd thus of the Meſſengers of their Gods, and call'd them <hi>Interpreters</hi> and <hi>Words,</hi> I cannot diſcern any greater Myſtery in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Paraphraſts, nor why they ſhould not give the ſame Names to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> or other Meſſengers, that ſpake to them on the behalf of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Maldonat</hi> (in <hi>Joan.</hi> 1.1.) did really obſerve well, that the Paraphraſts made uſe of this Term, when God was treated of, as converſing with and ſpeaking to us, or coming to aid and ſuccour us. This cannot be underſtood but of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Manifeſtation by the Miniſtry of an Angel: neither would it have been ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing, if what they ſaid of the Angels they had ſaid alſo of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> I mean in reſpect to his Commiſſion, but not at all in relation to an inviable Nature. And then, if you would have it that St. <hi>John</hi> did imitate the <hi>Jews,</hi> as to the uſe of this Term, I ſhall agree with you, provided it be in the ſenſe we have given, which is both plain, and agreeable to the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>We have obſerv'd already, <hi>p.</hi> 17, 18. that the Paraphraſts we ſpeak of do not make uſe of this Term <hi>Word,</hi> but only in thoſe places where the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Actions and Affections of God, expreſſeth them by the Terms of <hi>Face, Eyes, Feet, Hands,</hi> &amp;c. which are corporeal Parts, and belonging only to Man. We obſerv'd at the ſame time, that theſe ways of ſpeaking, which the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text makes uſe of, were ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this, that the Angel of God, who appear'd in God's Name, and had his Authority, did moſt commonly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the ſhape of a Man. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence I would draw from theſe two Remarks, is evident; and for this reaſon the Paraphraſts us'd this Term <hi>Word,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to denote the Divine Manifeſtation by Angels, under ſenſible Repreſentations, but particularly thoſe of a Human Voice and Shape. Their Teſtimony then is ſo far from favouring the Idea of a <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical Word,</hi> that it ſerves on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to confirm our <hi>Hypotheſis;</hi> which is, that we ought to underſtand by the <hi>Word,</hi> a ſenſible Manifeſtation of God, either in a bright Cloud, or by a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Voice, or by a Human Shape.</p>
                  <p>It is true that ſome Controvertiſts ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to us that Paſſage of the Paraphraſe upon the Pſalms, which is the worſt of all, <hi>viz.</hi> that upon Pſalm 110. <hi>The Lord ſaid to his Word.</hi> I know not where they had it; for in the Original it is <gap reason="foreign">

It is true indeed that Dr. <hi>Bull,</hi> in his <hi>Defence of the Council of</hi> Nice, quotes a Paraphraſe we have not, to prove the falſe Reading. But it is likely that thoſe who ſay they have ſeen it, ſaw but a <hi>Latin</hi> Tranſlation, which hath it <hi>Verbo ſuo</hi> in the Ablative, as the Grammarians term it, <hi>by his Word:</hi> and it is the ambiguity of the <hi>Latin</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, that impos'd on thoſe who ſaw not the Original. So true it is that Error always begets a Myſtery, and that even a Grammatical Ambiguity is capable to furniſh us with high-flown and gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous ones. What makes me think ſo, is this, that I have obſerv'd the like ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity in the Author of the imperfect Work on St. <hi>Matthew</hi> (in <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.8.) This Evangeliſt brings in the Centurion ſpeaking, <hi>Lord ſpeak the Word</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) And this Author, allegorizing no doubt on the Term <hi>Word,</hi> makes him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver himſelf thus: <q>Lord, you have need only to command one of your Meſſengers, and Angel, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and my Servant ſhall be healed;</q> whereas he meant only that our Saviour ſhould ſpeak the Word: altho I would not condemn abſolutely the Explication of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, becauſe it is ſomewhat plauſible, if we regard how the Centurion goes on: <q>For I am, ſaith he, a Man under Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, having Soldiers under me: and I ſay unto this Man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my Servant, Do this, and he doth it.</q> Theſe Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſeem to inſinuate indeed, that he intended J. C. ſhould command ſome one of his Servants, as he commanded his own. Speak to an Angel, or to any one of your Diſciples, to go and heal my Servant, and my Servant ſhall be healed. And in this ſenſe an <hi>Angel,</hi> or an Apoſtle, would have been the <hi>Word</hi> of J. C. even as J. C. himſelf was the <hi>Word</hi> of the Father. If you take it thus, I ſhall grant with all my heart, that the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſt in this place means the Meſſiah by that Term <hi>Word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Judgment of Father <hi>Simon</hi> upon theſe Paraphraſes deſerves your notice (<hi>Hiſt. critic. du V. T. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>ch.</hi> 18.) <q>It is true, ſaith he, that <hi>Galatine,</hi> and many other Divines after him, made uſe of theſe Paraphraſes to eſtabliſh ſome Articles of our Faith, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the <hi>Jews,</hi> principally thoſe relating to the <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> But altho theſe Proofs ſeem concluſive as to the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe they are taken out of their Books; yet I do not think it advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to the Chriſtian Religion to have recourſe to Books ſtuff'd with Fables. — Beſides, the Paſſages we believe to favour our Religion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting chiefly but in Allegories, it will be eaſy for the <hi>Jews</hi> to evade them; for we cannot prove the Truth of our Myſteries invincibly by Allegories.</q> But if, notwithſtanding all theſe Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, the Trinitarians will ſtill inſiſt upon theſe Paraphraſts to authoriſe their pretended Myſtery, we ſhall be alarm'd ſo little at the advantage they pretend to get by them, that we ſhall over and above lend them this Paſſage of the <hi>Targum</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> extremely fit to prove the Pre-exiſtence of their <hi>Word.

                     <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> Concerning the Method of the Sacred Writers, and ſome of their Diſciples, <hi>viz. Hermas, Barnabas,</hi> &amp;c. in the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Scriptures.</head>
                  <p>THE Writers of the New Teſtament being <hi>Jews</hi> by Birth, did affect, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Genius of that People, an analogick Senſe and Accommodations, finding every where Relations between the Old and the New Teſtament. Every body knows how they have adapted one Hiſtory to another, one Event to another Event, and of what nature are their frequent Alluſions and Allegories. On this wiſe, to omit other Examples, what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith of the Word of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the Creature out of nothing, St. <hi>John</hi> accommodates to that Word of J. C. which forms Men anew, and manifeſts the Power of God, demonſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Miracles that all Creatures obey him: J. C. being not ſo much the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of the Will of God, as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of his Power. You will find this Analogick Senſe may be obſerv'd in moſt of the Paſſages of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, which the Apoſtles have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the New. <hi>Beza</hi> (on 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6.) calls this Senſe <hi>Anagogical,</hi> that is to ſay, Spiritual, Sublime, Myſtical, and exalted above the pitch of the Letter. See <hi>Scult.</hi> (<hi>Exerc. Evangel. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 62.) where he ſpeaks at large of the manner how the Sayings of the Prophets are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd analogically under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <q>The Teſtimonies of the Old Teſtament, ſaith he, are not always alledg'd to confirm a thing, but to illuſtrate it by an ingenious and well-contriv'd Accommodation, which is very familiar to the Holy Ghoſt.</q> The <hi>Therapeutes,</hi> or <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Philoſophers of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> retain'd this way of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting, the more willingly, becauſe it was altogether conformable to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> among whom they liv'd. <hi>Euſebius</hi> relates (<hi>Hiſt. Eccl. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 16.) <q>that they had the merely Allegorical Commentaries of the Antients; and that in expounding the Scriptures they philoſophiz'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of their Predeceſſors, that is to ſay, by the way of Figures and Allegories, pretending that the Letter is but a Shell wherein many Myſteries are inclos'd.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The moſt antient Fathers of the Church, <hi>viz. Hermas</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> did follow this Method of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a Spiritual Meaning in the Facts and Rites of the Old Teſtament, in order to adapt them to the New; but yet not ſo as to bring in ſuch <hi>Platonick</hi> Ideas as obtain'd ſome time after in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion: The following Fathers having not only carry'd their Allegories too far, and exceeded the antient manner of affecting myſtical Senſes, but alſo ſpoil'd this Method by joining groſs <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſm</hi> with it, which perſonaliz'd every thing, and turn'd the Anagogick into an Hiſtorical and Literal Senſe.</p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:200403:32"/>
                  <p>Let us begin with <hi>Barnabas.</hi> The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writers having ſaid that J. C. was the <hi>Rock of the Deſert,</hi> the <hi>Paſſover, Propitiation,</hi> &amp;c. in like manner <hi>Barnabas,</hi> accuſtom'd to the Method his Nation fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd ever ſince the Captivity, accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates to J. C. many Paſſages of the Old Teſtament, which had their myſtick and ſpiritual Truth in him. According to this way of interpreting, the <hi>Rock</hi> was J. C. intelligibly; <hi>David</hi> was J. C. ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogically. The Antients tempted J. C. becauſe they tempted <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, who were the Types of the Meſſiah: So that it might ſafely be ſaid, that Chriſt was an <hi>intelligible Moſes,</hi> an <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible David,</hi> or <hi>Rock;</hi> and conſequently an <hi>intelligible Word,</hi> in the ſame ſenſe that <hi>Heſychius</hi> calls the Blood of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, <hi>intelligible Blood;</hi> that is to ſay, a myſtical Blood, which is conceiv'd ſuch only by our Thought and Mind, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing really ſo, and in the very Letter. For who can ſo much as doubt that the <hi>Word</hi> is J. C. or that J. C. is the <hi>Word,</hi> by the which God created the World, in the ſame ſenſe as he is the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> or the <hi>Rock</hi> of the Deſert? That is to ſay, there is found in him myſtically that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Efficacy, or that powerful Word, which ſpeaks, which commands, and the Creature immediately obeys its Orders. God ſaid, <hi>Let there be Light, and there was Light:</hi> J. C. ſaid, <hi>Let this blind Man recover his Sight,</hi> and there was Light, the <hi>blind Man ſaw it<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>;</hi> he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd his Miracles by a Word only. Can you accommodate better the Old Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to the New? And that ſo much the more, becauſe the ſame <hi>Word</hi> which cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the World acted in the Fleſh of J. C. the which it not only inhabited, having deſcended on it in the ſhape of a Dove, but into which it had likewiſe inſinuated it ſelf as the principle of his Conception and Birth. But that you may not believe me upon my bare word, I will prove my Hypotheſis by <hi>Barnabas</hi> his own Epiſtle. The moſt plauſible Argument is drawn from Chap. 4. where the <hi>Greek</hi> is wanting. <q>Chriſt, ſaith this Father, is the Lord of the World, to whom God ſaid, before the Foundation of the World, <hi>Let us make Man,</hi> &amp;c.</q> But it appears by Chap. 5. whereof we have the Original, that <hi>Barnabas</hi> takes theſe Words in an allegoric and ſpiritual Senſe: Reading alone takes away the difficulty. <q>God, as he ſaith, having renewed us by the Remiſſion of our Sins, hath made us as it were Children, and reſtor'd to us a Form totally ſpiritual. For the Scripture ſpeaks thus of us, introducing God <hi>as it were</hi> ſpeaking to his Son, <hi>Let us make Man according to our Image.</hi> And the Lord, behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our new Nature, hath ſaid to us, <hi>Increaſe,</hi> &amp;c. Behold now how he hath ſpoken to his Son. I will once more ſhew you how God hath given you a new Figure in theſe laſt Times: The Lord ſaith, <hi>Behold I make all things new.</hi>
                     </q> It is as clear as the Sun, that this Expreſſion, <hi>Let us make Man,</hi> is applied to the <hi>New Creation,</hi> to the ſecond Form that God gives us: and that when God hath thus reform'd us by the Spirit of his Son, he hath as it were ſaid to his Son, <hi>Let us make Man.</hi> You need not doubt then that the ſame alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorick Senſe is to be look'd for in Chap. 4. which without any ground is taken lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally. Whatever God ſaith according to the Letter, either ſpeaking to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, or conſulting himſelf, may aſſuredly be ſaid, in a myſtical Senſe, to have been ſpoken to his Son, by whoſe means he hath made a new Man. As if <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſhould ſay, What God ſaith at the time of the firſt Creation, <hi>Let us make Man according to our Image,</hi> is found true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the New, but in a more ſublime Senſe, having in this made uſe of his Son to form Man according to the Image of his Holineſs and Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>And if <hi>Barnabas</hi> did explain allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically this Saying, <hi>Let us make Man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Image;</hi> why might not the Fathers in like manner explain theſe, <hi>He ſpake, and the things were created?</hi>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:200403:32"/>Hidden and myſtical Meanings were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſought for in the Old Teſtament. This <hi>Ignatius</hi> did in his Epiſte to the <hi>Epheſians.</hi> 
                     <q>There is but one Teacher, ſaith he, <hi>that ſpake, and the thing was done;</hi> and all that he did in <hi>ſilence</hi> (not only by teaching, but alſo ſuffering) is altogether worthy of his Father.</q> Where you ſee he applies to J. C. what was ſaid of God the Father; and to the New Creation, what was ſaid of the Old. This is viſible by the diſtinction he makes between the <hi>Speech</hi> and the <hi>Silence</hi> of J. C. between what he perform'd by his Preaching, and what he did by his Obedience and Patience.</p>
                  <p>Let us go on with <hi>Barnabas.</hi> In Chap. 5. whilſt allegorizing on the Land of Promiſe, which flow'd with Milk and Honey; <q>We are thoſe (ſaith he, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us Chriſtians) whom God hath brought into this bleſſed Land, being nouriſh'd with the Faith of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</q> And carrying on his Allegory in Chap. 6. <hi>Enter into this Bleſſed Land,</hi> &amp;c. to which he gives that ſpiritual Meaning: <q>Learn what <hi>Knowledg</hi> ſaith (<gap reason="foreign">

In the ſame Chapter he adapts to J. C. what was ſaid of the Sacrifices of old, and particularly that of <hi>Iſaac:</hi> He finds there a Figure of the Church, as alſo of J. C. and concludes thus: <hi>This Calf, this Victim is J. C.</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) Could he ſay that the Calf ſacrific'd was J. C. and may he not, by the ſame way of ſpeaking, be call'd the <hi>Word?</hi> Becauſe this was not only his Figure, but alſo the <hi>Virtue</hi> that actuated him in the Formation of the New World. In the <hi>7th</hi> Chapter he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorizeth ſtrangely upon the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: He finds there a certain <hi>Cabala,</hi> in the number of the Perſons whom <hi>Abraham</hi> cauſed to be circumcis'd; and diſcovers there the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as alſo his Croſs, and what not. This Science is pregnant with Inventions, it can find J. C. every where, in an Arithmetick Number, 318; in the Plural Number of a Noun, <hi>The Gods have created;</hi> and in the Plural Number of a Verb, <hi>Let <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s make Man.</hi> See in Chap. 8. his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Meanings which he draws from the Prohibition of the Fleſh of ſome Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and taking notice that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid this only in a Figure, regarding the myſtical Senſe, the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and not the <hi>Letter; "Moſes,</hi> ſaith he, ſpake thus <hi>in Spirit</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) If then <hi>Moſes</hi> did ſpeak of J. C. when he ſaid, that <hi>the Word created the World;</hi> he did ſpeak of this alſo <hi>in Spirit,</hi> and it is not true but in a ſpiritual Senſe. In the <hi>9th</hi> Chapter, beſides the Allegory on the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Baptiſm, and upon the Croſs of J.C. whereof he hath found a thouſand Figures in the Hiſtory of the People of old, which he brings to his bent by Violence and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; he ſeeks particularly for a ſublime Senſe in the Name of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> or <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of <hi>Nun.</hi> He ſaith, <q>That the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath ſhew'd us in <hi>Joſhua</hi> every thing that may be ſaid of his Son <hi>Jeſus:</hi>
                     </q> inſomuch that it may be ſaid, according to him, that J. C. brought the People of the <hi>Jews</hi> into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> becauſe he had done it in <hi>Joſhua</hi> his Figure; or rather, becauſe he did the ſame in a ſpiritual Senſe. So that J. C. was <hi>Joſhua,</hi> by whom ſo many Miracles were wrought in the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and for the ſame reaſon J. C. was the <hi>Word</hi> by which all things were made. I ſay, the <hi>Word;</hi> for altho <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> makes no mention of it in all his Epiſtle, yet he makes an alluſion thereto in theſe Words, <hi>Let <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s make Man;</hi> which he applies to J. C. Laſtly, <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> adds, <q>Behold here Jeſus again, not the Son of Man, but the Son of God, who appear'd in Fleſh in his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</q> Who ſees not here that Jeſus the Son, not of a Man, as <hi>Joſhua</hi> was, but the Son of God, being born of a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:200403:33"/>Virgin, did manifeſt himſelf in Fleſh, in a typical and figurative manner, in the Perſon of <hi>Joſhua?</hi> We may ſay likewiſe, according to this way of interpreting the Scriptures, that the ſame Jeſus created the World in the Perſon of that, <hi>Spirit,</hi> or of that Word, which ſpake, and the Creature appear'd: becauſe that firſt <hi>Word</hi> was the Type of that other <hi>Word,</hi> which inſinuated it ſelf into J. C. and which ſaid, for example, <hi>Lazarus come forth,</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> came forth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately out of his Tomb, and from the Dead. That gave Life, and ſo did this. You may in the ſame ſenſe, as moſt of the Fathers did, ſay that J. C. appear'd to the Patriarchs; becauſe the appearing of the Angels in a Human Shape, was the Type of his Manifeſtation in Fleſh. Hence comes it that <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> calls him the myſtical Angel: the Angel being J. C. in a <hi>Type,</hi> and J. C. being the Angel in a <hi>Myſtery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover <hi>Barnabas</hi> continuing his Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory upon the Sabbath and the Temple, whence he is continually drawing forth myſtical Interpretations, and having run over all the Figures of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ſpiritual Application he makes of them to J. C. and his Church; he calls this Parables, and concludes: <hi>You have here,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>all that regards the Glory of J. C.</hi> viz. <hi>how all things were made for him and by him.</hi> Where by <hi>all things,</hi> without doubt, all thoſe Diſpenſations of the old Oeconomy are to be underſtood, which have any rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him, to his Birth, Death or Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; the which he may be ſaid to have done, not literally, but ſpiritually, in the Perſon of the Prophets who were his Figures. This is ſo clear by the ſequel and coherence of his Diſcourſe, that I have been amaz'd at the Confidence of Dr. <hi>Bull,</hi> who, in his <hi>Defence of the Council of</hi> Nice, <hi>p.</hi> 67. dares to quote theſe Words, as if <hi>Barnabas</hi> had ſaid them of the firſt Creation. For it is ſo far from theſe Expreſſions being ſerviceable to his Hypotheſis, that they demonſtrate on the contrary how theſe Words, <hi>that all things</hi> were made by J. C. are to be underſtood; that is, becauſe either he did them in his Types, as <hi>Barnabas</hi> teaches us here, or becauſe he meant that the ſame Power, or one like to that which created the old World, and inſpired the Prophets, did dwell in J. C. Whoever knows the Character of <hi>Barnabas</hi> but a little, muſt be very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, if he gives any other Senſe to his Words. See here the Judgment of Mr. <hi>Du Pin</hi> concerning him, (<hi>Biblioth. Tom.</hi> 1. at the Word <hi>Barnabas</hi>) <q>The Epiſtle of this Father, ſaith he, is full of forc'd Allegories on the Holy Scriptures, and with extraordinary Explications deviating from good Senſe — But theſe Allegories, theſe myſtical Explications and Fables, hinder not this Epiſtle from being his whoſe Name it bears. You muſt have but a ſmall inſight into the Genius of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the firſt Chriſtians brought up in the Synagogue, if you believe that ſuch kind of Thoughts could not be theirs. On the contrary, this was their very Character, they learn'd of the <hi>Jews</hi> to turn the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures into an Allegory. —We ought not then to wonder, that St. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> a <hi>Jew</hi> by Birth, and writing to the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſhould explain allegorically ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Paſſages of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and apply them to the New. —Every body knows that the Books of the firſt Chriſtians are full of this ſort of Fables and Allegories.</q>
                  </p>

                     </gap> is very familiar to this Author, he means by it a ſublime and profound Senſe. This appears by his infinitely extolling this <hi>Knowledg</hi> (which he alſo names <hi>Science</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi>) above the Vertues which accompany Faith. This way of diſtinguiſhing Science from Faith, was follow'd by <hi>Origen:</hi> it ſeems that <hi>Gnoſticiſm</hi> was brought in by this Allegorick <hi>Science</hi> of the Scriptures, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:200403:33"/>afterwards degenerated into Poetical Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations and an Heatheniſh Philoſophy. The firſt Method was <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Platonic.</hi> All which ſeems to prove that the Author of this Epiſtle was a true <hi>Gnoſtic:</hi> I mean one of the firſt of them, who imitated the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Cabala in their myſtical Interpretations of the Old Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament, which was accounted a ſublime Science; but not one of thoſe <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> who were afterwards decried for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting that Allegoric Science into a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy merely Pagan. For theſe laſt who were <hi>Gentile</hi> Proſelytes, imagining they had the ſame right with the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte <hi>Jews,</hi> to the uſe of theſe Allegoric Interpretations, adapted preſently the <hi>Theogony</hi> of their Poets, and the Ideas of <hi>Plato,</hi> to the Evangelical Truths. The former ſought for a myſtical ſenſe of the Law, but the latter the ſublime ſenſe of Philoſophy, both of them in relation to Jeſus Chriſt and his Holy Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe of the latter ſort who paſſed the Bounds in this Method, and made ſo wide a <hi>Pleroma,</hi> were called Hereticks: but thoſe that uſed it with a greater Caution and Modeſty, and who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the <hi>Pleroma</hi> no further than the three Aeons (which ſeemed to have ſome ground in the Scriptures) and kept a Decorum better in their Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, had the good fortune to paſs for Orthodox even to Poſterity. I think it is better to argue thus about the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this Epiſtle, than to ſay with Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> that he oppoſeth <hi>Cabala</hi> to <hi>Cabala,</hi> and that by the Term <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, he attacks the falſe Science of the <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</hi> For it doth not appear that he diſputes with any body, unleſs it be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> who would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Allegories: However it doth not appear that <hi>Gnoſticiſm,</hi> ſuch as it was at that time confined to mere Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory on the Scripture, was then decried. On the contrary this Author recommends it, and that not in oppoſition to the falſe one, as <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> did afterwards, but abſolutely as it is in it ſelf. As for me, I doubt not at all, that the Jargon of the enſuing Fathers, who blended the <hi>Platonic</hi> Studies with the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Method, did proceed from this way of philoſophizing allegorically on the Scriptures, which was very innocent at firſt; or rather they coupled together the two Methods of allegorizing, namely the <hi>Oriental</hi> and the Greek. <hi>Clement, Hermas</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> carried on their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legory according to the Oriental Cuſtom, in order to find out the myſtic ſenſe: The enſuing Fathers, newly come out of <hi>Plato</hi>'s School, and having an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary conceit of his Principles, did from an innocent Allegory build up a Pagan Philoſophy, which, in giving us <hi>three Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſes,</hi> gives us alſo <hi>three Gods</hi> literally ſo, and well told.</p>
                  <p>Father <hi>Simon</hi> both ſaw and own'd this Truth in his Supplement to the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Jews</hi> (<hi>pag.</hi> 16.) <q>Some of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſaith he, applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the <hi>Platonic</hi> Philoſophy, which they have blended with their Phrenzies, whence aroſe a great part of their Cabaliſtic Sciences. We ought alſo to attribute to this their ſtudying of the <hi>Platonic</hi> Philoſophy, many Expreſſions found in their <hi>anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Allegorical Books,</hi> which are not far diſtant from thoſe the Chriſtians uſe to explain the Myſtery of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</q> Let us conſider well this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark. It demonſtrates that the Trinity was not drawn from the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for if the <hi>Platonic Jews,</hi> who had not a grain of Chriſtianity, did talk of this Myſtery like the Chriſtians, and that we ought to attribute theſe Expreſſions only to the Mixture of the <hi>Platonic</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy with their Phrenzies, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low then that the Chriſtians likewiſe, either brought this Doctrine out of the School of <hi>Plato,</hi> or took it from the Phrenzies of the <hi>Jews:</hi> and we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to believe this to be ſo, becauſe the Fathers who talked of it came out of that School, and profeſſed Platoniſm, before they were ingaged to Chriſtianity,

The Writings of <hi>Hegeſippus,</hi> the moſt conſiderable of the Chriſtian <hi>Jews</hi> of whom we have any account, periſh'd becauſe of his Errors; as <hi>Valeſius</hi> upon <hi>Euſebius</hi> obſerves it, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe he ſpoke not the Language of <hi>Plato.</hi> The reſt had the ſame Fate, there being but few that remain, as <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Hermas.</hi> But have theſe talked of a <hi>Pre-exiſtent Word?</hi> Not at all, unleſs it be in Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The Reaſon of this, I pray? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly becauſe they found it not in the Chriſtian Religion, nor yet in the <hi>Jewiſh;</hi> and having not ſtudied in the School of <hi>Plato,</hi> they could not bring it thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church of J. C.</p>
                  <p>As to the Books of <hi>Hegeſippus</hi> which periſhed becauſe of their Errors, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the <hi>Defender of the Fathers</hi> doth ſomewhat exclaim, that <hi>Valeſius</hi> did not declare expreſly that they peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by reaſon of any Errors contrary to <hi>Platoniſm.</hi> A mere wrangling! As if the Doctrine of <hi>Plato</hi> were not at that time, and many Ages after, the only Rule by which Truth and Error were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd. <hi>Valeſius</hi> in this place ſpeaks of two ſorts of Books that periſhed becauſe of their Errors. The firſt, that gave him occaſion to mention the other, were the <hi>Hypotypoſes</hi> of <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who had poſitive Errors wherewith <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm</hi> was offended. Pray read the 109 Cod. of <hi>Photius,</hi> where this Critic relates them. I dare ſay that the <hi>Eternity of Matter, the Tranſmigration or the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Souls, the Commerce of Angels with Women,</hi> and other ſuch like Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, which <hi>Photius</hi> aſcribes to <hi>Clement,</hi> troubled not much the good <hi>Platoniſts.</hi> We know that for the greateſt part theſe were their Darlings. What was it then, at which they were ſo much offended? Thoſe other Errors which overthrew the <hi>Platonic</hi> Hypotheſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Generation and Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Word, viz.</hi> 
                     <q>The Son's being numbred among the Creatures; and that neither of the two <hi>Words</hi> that came out of the Father was incarnated, not ſo much as the leſſer of them; but only that a certain Virtue flowing from the Word it ſelf, did inſinuate it ſelf into the Minds of Men, and there became their Underſtanding or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</q> This good Father believed no other Incarnation than that of Human Reaſon, which flowed out like a Ray from the Subſtance of God, and deſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fleſh of Men, to become their Guide and Light. He was a true Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.</p>
                  <p>The other Books <hi>Valeſius</hi> names are thoſe of <hi>Hegeſippus</hi> and <hi>Papias,</hi> which in relation to <hi>Platoniſm</hi> could not be guilty of other Errors but thoſe of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: that is to ſay, they periſhed becauſe of their Simplicity, and becauſe they talked not like <hi>Plato.</hi> And we have reaſon to believe the ſame Fate had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe attended ſome other of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:200403:34"/>that remain, which, as <hi>Photius</hi> jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, are too ſimple and too much reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in relation to the Divinity of J. C. but that ſome ſmall reſpect for them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them. The firſt Ages regarded them as parts of the Holy Scripture, and this Credit they had got in the Church, preſerv'd them from Shipwrack. The <hi>Defender</hi> is then to know, that the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent about the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Incarnation,</hi> did always regulate the Fate of Books and Authors; and that <hi>Orthodoxy</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terodoxy</hi> were judged of, according to theſe Favourite Tenents of <hi>Plato.</hi> Why I pray, have the four firſt General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, of which the World rings ſo much, deſtroyed ſo many Books and Men? Was it not for theſe two Tenents? All the rampant Diſputes ever ſince turn'd upon thoſe Hinges. The reaſon hereof is, for that the Truth of theſe two Articles lies in an <hi>indiviſible Point,</hi> all around are Precipices of Error; there being ſo ſmall a diſtance between Truth and Error, that it is altogether imperceptible. The <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarians</hi> are divided into <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal.</hi> Among the Real Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> hath his particular Hypotheſis, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> his, as alſo Mr. <hi>How.</hi> Amongſt the Nominal, the Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> is of one Opinion, Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> of another, Dr. <hi>South</hi> differs from them both. Range them by Hundreds, there will not be one that will keep to the <hi>preciſe Point,</hi> that forms this Chimerical Orthodoxy, which is boaſted of by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, but attained to by none, for they treat one another as Hereticks. Here is a large Field for you to ſcour about, and raiſe a thouſand nice Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in, which the moſt acute can't perceive, and to find Hereſies in thoſe that have had the Misfortune to diſpleaſe you. Muſt an overgrown Biſhop be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, whoſe See lies convenient for me, or a Competitor ſtopt in his Career? I have no more to do but only examine them about theſe two Points in queſtion; if they have not found the <hi>indiviſible Point</hi> preciſely, and who can do it? They are undone: I will prove demonſtratively that their Opinion is <hi>Heretical, Impious</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemous.</hi> I ſhall call both the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> to my Aid: and what is more, I ſhall have the Pleaſure to ſee three or four hundred Biſhops aſſembled in a General Council, who ſhall unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly vote for me, for the accuſed is always in the wrong; the Thunderbolts and Anathemas ſhall follow. Thus the whole World will be in a Flame for a Trifle. Alas! the Memory of ſuch a Number of vain Diſputes between <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorius</hi> and <hi>Eutyches</hi> cannot be renewed, without making the Chriſtian World to bluſh. But whoever could give us the ſecret Hiſtory of all the antient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, like to that of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> would certainly infinitely oblige the Chriſtian World.</p>
                  <p>But laſtly, perhaps the Defender did not perceive my having anſwer'd his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling Difficulty before hand: let us then make him ſenſible of it. Let us examine the Reliſh of the Antients, and ſee what Books they have preſerved for us, what Character they bear, and of what Stamp they are. I told you already, that they have not left us any Father of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of the Circumciſion, but only ſome Gentiles brought up in the School of <hi>Plato.</hi> We have indeed a <hi>Juſtin, Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagoras, Theophilus, Tatian, Irenaeus, Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexand, Origen, Tertullian, Arnobius, Lactantius,</hi> and ſome others of the ſame ſort, Fathers indeed who breathe nothing but Platoniſm. This is the precious Relick Antiquity has left us: It is eaſy then to draw the conſequence, What Books hath it deſtroyed? All thoſe that ſhocked <hi>Plato,</hi> that ſpake not as <hi>Plato.</hi> We do the <hi>Defender</hi> Juſtice, if from the Books that Antiquity choſe, we point out thoſe it rejected. He hath then loſt his Cauſe; for the Collection we have, could not be ſuch by Chance, the Caprice of the Times, or ſuch like Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents: No, it is too uniform; Choice preſided here at leaſt as to the Character of theſe Books; but Time and the Fate
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:200403:35"/>of Libraries, may have had a ſhare in the reſt.</p>
                  <p>I return to my Subject, and muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve here, that if the Allegories of <hi>Barnabas</hi> are very evident, becauſe they are ſo frequent and characteriz'd by the Terms of <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Figure,</hi> which he makes uſe of to denote them to be ſo, yet this happens not always. The Fathers ſpeak them out often ſo abſolutely, that it is only the Matter it ſelf that can make us diſcern them. Thus the Allegories of <hi>Origen</hi> have often deceived his Readers: <q>For this Father, as Mr. <hi>Huet</hi> obſerves it (<hi>Origen. Quaeſt.</hi> 14.) paſſing often from the Explication of the Letter to a Spiritual Senſe imperceptibly, his Readers took his Allegories for Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Aſſertions.</q> What he hath ſaid of <hi>Origen</hi> may be applied to all the reſt of the Fathers: <hi>Irenaeus</hi> for example (<hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 37.) ſpeaks out (in down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Terms, without any hint of a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure) an Allegory he made upon the Spies ſent by <hi>Joſhua</hi> to <hi>Jericho:</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>Rahab</hi> the Harlot, ſaith he, in receiving the Spies, conceal'd in her Houſe the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                     </q> Who would not believe, if you take this literally, as the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> are wont, but that theſe Spies were actually the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in a human Shape, there being nothing in the Words here to hint the Adaptation and Allegory? Really, if <hi>Irenaeus</hi> had ſaid, as he might very well at this rate, that <hi>Abraham</hi> receiving the Angels that went to deſtroy <hi>Sodom,</hi> gave a Dinner to the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> a Myſtery would certainly have been found in theſe Words, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that <hi>Abraham</hi> did entertain theſe three Perſons of the Deity, who appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him in the Form of three Angels or three Men?</p>
                  <p>What difference is there, I pray, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this way of ſpeaking we now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and what <hi>Irenaeus</hi> really made uſe of? None, and you muſt grant, that if you think you have good ground, from ſuch like Expreſſions, to make a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God in three Perſons, of the three Angels; you may likewiſe conclude the Spies of <hi>Jericho,</hi> to have been the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> really and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally ſo. For whatever may be ſaid to the contrary, it is as impoſſible that Angels ſhould be God, as for the Spies to be ſo. Surely the Repugnancy in the Nature of the things themſelves, which Authors compare mutually, ought always to determine us to look for a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative and allegoric ſenſe there, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when it appears to us, that theſe Allegories are agreeable to the Genius and Cuſtom of thoſe Authors, or at leaſt of their Predeceſſors and Maſters; it being certain, that tho the Diſciples often alter the Method of their Maſters, yet there will ſtill remain ſome Footſteps of the antient Doctrine, betraying and diſcovering their Innovations. This is the Lot of the <hi>Platonic</hi> Fathers, as we ſhall ſhow hereafter.</p>
                  <p>For the preſent the Example of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> is ſufficient to inform us, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſame way of ſpeaking, which calls the Spies the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> we may alſo ſay that J. C. was the <hi>Word</hi> which created the World, and the Angel that appeared to the Patriarchs. See what Annotator <hi>Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erdentius</hi> ſaith on this Paſſage of <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> 
                     <q>An old Copy adds the Word <hi>Three</hi> to the Spies, which would agree very well with the three Divine <hi>Hypoſtaſes,</hi> had not the Scripture aſſured us that there were but <hi>Two</hi> and not <hi>Three.</hi>

                     <hi>Juſtin</hi> hath alſo much the ſame Allegory in his Dialogue. It is likely that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> carried on his Allegory but to the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and <hi>Son,</hi> in relation to the two Spies: but for fear the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſhould be thereby excluded, ſome Knave put him in too; and then the Word <hi>Three</hi> muſt be added to the <hi>Spies,</hi> that ſo all might be adjuſted to the three Divine Perſons. Thus various Readings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Boldneſs of the Orthodox: but howeven it be, you ſee the Allegory; either reject it in this Place, or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:200403:35"/>it every where elſe, where there is the like neceſſity for it. As the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> were allegorically in the Spies of <hi>Jericho;</hi> in like manner J. C. was allegorically in all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of old, in the <hi>Word</hi> that cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the World, in the Angels and the Prophets that ſpake to Men; becauſe, if I may ſay ſo, theſe Diſpenſations were the Figures of the great Oeconomy of J. C. or rather of God the <hi>Father,</hi> manifeſting himſelf in the Fleſh of his <hi>Son.</hi> Therefore <hi>Irenaeus</hi> calls it the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation which was from the Beginning. You may ſee what <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſaith in his Notes concerning theſe Allegories of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> and the other Fathers: <q>It is known by all, ſaith he, how theſe firſt Chriſtians interpreted the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, after a myſtic and ſuperſtitious manner;</q> I was like to ſay childiſh and fooliſh. <hi>Cotelier</hi> ſaith almoſt the ſame, and ſhews their Abſurdities. But take this along with you, that theſe dull Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories did not by far ſo much Miſchief, as that Chriſtianity in Maſquerade, which ſome other Fathers borrowed from <hi>Plato.</hi> It is of theſe you may more juſtly ſay, than of the Allegoriſts (according to one of our Criticks) that the Day theſe good Fathers were writing ſo many phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophic Viſions, they voided a Purge, <hi>(Purgamentum aliquod cacaſſe.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us now come to <hi>Hermas,</hi> who is as well ſtored with Viſions and Parables as <hi>Barnabas:</hi> At leaſt his Method is the ſame. In his Parable or Similitude the <hi>9th,</hi> §. 12. he ſaith, <q>That the Rock is the Son of God; now the Rock is of old, becauſe the Son of God is more antient than any Creature, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he aſſiſted in the Council of his Father, in order to form the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</q> All this is ſaid in a myſtic and an allegoric ſenſe, to explain that the Father did all in regard to his Son and the new Creation: The Author having ſaid as much in his firſt Viſion, §. 4. concerning the Church: for asking of the Angel, <q>Why the Church of God is an old Woman; the Angel anſwers, becauſe ſhe was the firſt thing that was created, and that it was by reaſon of her the World was made</q> (It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the Greek it was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which the Tranſlator rendered not <hi>per illam,</hi> but <hi>propter illam</hi>) You ſee then that this Father ſaith no more of J. C. than he doth of the Church; and that theſe Words <hi>antiquior omni Creatura</hi> mean the ſame thing with <hi>anus prima omnium creata,</hi> which are true only in a myſtic ſenſe, but falſe in the Letter. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently then J. C. is <hi>from the Beginning</hi> in the ſame ſenſe, that the Church is ſo: I mean in the Decree and Deſign of God, which the Author expreſſeth by his <hi>being in the Council of the Father,</hi> which he borrowed manifeſtly from the Author of the Book of <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> I ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a remarkable Inſtance of the Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that enſued as to the Tenent it ſelf, notwithſtanding the Terms remained the ſame. You ſee that <hi>Hermas</hi> ſaith here, <hi>the Son of God is more antient than any Creature,</hi> and that he ſpeaks ſo alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorically: Let us get over one Age or two, and you ſhall ſee <hi>Origen</hi> making uſe of the ſame Expreſſion, but in an <hi>Arian</hi> ſenſe: <q>The Holy Scriptures, ſaith he (<hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>contra Celſ.</hi>) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Son of God to us, <hi>as the moſt antient of all the Creatures</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>)</q> He means that he was created a little before the World: but let us return to our Subject.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> who firſt taught the <hi>Pre-exiſtence</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> imitating the Notion of <hi>Hermas,</hi> did teach the Pre-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of Chriſtians no leſs than that of Chriſt himſelf, whilſt (<hi>Apol.</hi> 2.) he ſaith, <q>That all thoſe who were Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as well <hi>Greeks</hi> as <hi>Barbarians,</hi> were Chriſtians; and conſequently Chriſtians did not commence yeſterday or to day, but were always and every where <hi>a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipio,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>from the beginning;</hi>

                     </gap>roach of Novelty, wherewith Chriſtianity was charged. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Euſehius,</hi> endeavouring to prove that the Chriſtian Religion was not new, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that the Patriarchs profeſt it, and that it was inſtituted <hi>from the beginning</hi> (<hi>Hiſt. Eccleſ. Lib. c.</hi> 4.) Thus much he cannot advance but in a myſtic ſenſe, as he obſerves it himſelf, becauſe all thoſe, who acted juſtly and ſerved that God who is above all, were Chriſtians. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently then Chriſt could not converſe otherwiſe with them, but in the ſame manner as they profeſſed Chriſtianity; which cannot be true, but by way of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy</hi> and <hi>Accommodation.</hi> Chriſt then pre-exiſted, as the Chriſtian Religion and Chriſtians did pre-exiſt.</p>
                  <p>Let us return to <hi>Hermas.</hi> It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that he allegoriz'd, even by his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituling his third Book, where he ſpeaks of the Pre-exiſtence of J. C. <hi>Similitudes</hi> or <hi>Parables,</hi> which carry on throughout ſpiritual and myſtic ſenſes, as is evident by <hi>Similitude</hi> 5. where he explains the Parable of the Father of a Family in a theological manner, in relation to the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and the <hi>Son.</hi> The <hi>Father</hi> in the Plan of his Allegory is the <hi>Landlord,</hi> the Holy Spirit is the <hi>Son</hi> of the Houſhold; and he who out of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory is called the <hi>Son,</hi> is but a Servant in the Allegory. <q>The Landlord, ſaith he, is the ſame who created all things, the Son is the Holy Ghoſt, and the <hi>Son of God</hi> is the Servant.</q> He goes on, and adds a little after: <q>The Holy Ghoſt inſinuated himſelf into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy wherein God was to dwell; and this Body whereinto the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> did inſinuate himſelf, having ſerved the Holy Ghoſt, and having been faithful to him always, did obtain the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of God by his Labours and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</q> By the Holy Ghoſt cannot be meant here the ſecond Perſon, which is called the Divine Nature of J. C. as Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> pretends; for who ſees not that <hi>Hermas</hi> ſpeaks here of that Spirit of Sanctification, which prepared the Body of J. C. for Prophecy, and conſecrated it for a Temple for God to dwell in? And ſeeing this Idea of the Holy Spirit's being infus'd into the Body of J. C. is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to what the Holy Scriptures deliver concerning it, you muſt be very extravagant if you think that <hi>Hermas</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from it? Beſides, what could he mean, if his ſenſe were the ſame with that Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> attributes to him? Would he introduce two <hi>Sons of God,</hi> ſo oppoſite one to the other? The one who ſerves and obeys, and the other who is ſerved and obeyed; and what is yet more ſtrange, <hi>two Sons of God</hi> in the ſelf-ſame Perſon of J. C. our Lord. <q>The Son, ſaith <hi>Hermas,</hi> is the Holy Spirit, and the <hi>Son of God</hi> is the Servant.</q> Now if the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> of J. C. be denoted by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and that the Servant ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the <hi>Human Nature,</hi> you will have <hi>two Sons</hi> according to the very Letter. Thus the Orthodox embroil all things to fiſh for Myſteries in Troubled Water; whereas nothing is more clear than the meaning of <hi>Hermas.</hi> He allegorizeth and would ſay, By him whom the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble calls the Son, I mean nothing elſe but the Holy Spirit; and by him whom the Parable calls a Servant, I mean J. C. our Lord, who out of the Parable is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Son of God:</hi> And behold here the ground of my Allegory, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Holy Spirit, who inſinuated himſelf into J. C. becoming his Director and Maſter, may juſtly be compar'd to the <hi>Son of the Family;</hi> but J. C. himſelf having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways obeyed the Holy Spirit, muſt be compared to a <hi>Servant.</hi> It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Allegory that J. C. is the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; and ſo likewiſe in Allegory, that the Holy Spirit is the Son of God: It is in Allegory that the Church is the firſt of all the Creatures; and conſequently in Allegory, that the Son of God is more antient than all the Creatures, and that he aſſiſted at the Council of God. The whole is Allegory in <hi>Hermas,</hi> the whole is
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:200403:36"/>
                     <hi>Viſion, Similitude</hi> and <hi>Parable</hi> there. The Faith in his Writings (<hi>Simil.</hi> 9. § 13, and 15.) and all the other Vertues are called <hi>Holy Spirits;</hi> he uſhers them in like Virgins well apparel'd, kiſſing the <hi>Son of God,</hi> who alſo lie with <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> himſelf as with a Brother. The Fiction of Perſons is ſo familiar to this Author, that if you would find a Perſon of the Trinity there, you ſhall but catch at a ſhadow. Let it then be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all, that we ought not to look for any thing but Allegories and Similitudes in this Book of his, bearing the ſame Title. Whereas in the ſecond Book en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled the <hi>Commandments,</hi> where the Doctrines are ſet forth more ſimply, he ſpeaks not from the very firſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but of one God the Creator; which is the whole Idea he gives us of this ſupreme Being, without any menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of three Perſons, of an eternal Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, or Incarnation. Which demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates that he had a different Idea from that of a <hi>Conſubſtantial Trinity,</hi> or of three equal <hi>Hypoſtaſes,</hi> whatever he ſaid elſewhere of the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>But as this Allegory of <hi>Hermas</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt miſled the <hi>Platonic</hi> Fathers, who took it literally, being prejudiced by the Philoſophy they were brought up in: There is another in the ſixth <hi>Commandment,</hi> by which they were no leſs impos'd on: <q>There is, ſaith he, two Genius's in Man, the one of Juſtice, the other of Iniquity.</q> The <hi>Greek</hi> had it, no doubt, <hi>two Angels;</hi> and ſo this Paſſage is read in the Tranſlator of <hi>Origen</hi> (<hi>Hom.</hi> 35. <hi>in Luc.</hi>) <hi>duos Angelos.</hi> Hereupon the Fathers have gravely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down to us, that there are <hi>two An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> the one of Good, the other of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, that attend a Man from his Birth. (Juſt as they have told us, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels fell in Love with the Daughters of Men, having miſtaken the Allegory of the Souls, that delight to abide in our Bodies) But let the Fathers talk on. This being taken in a literal ſenſe, is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous and contrary to Scripture, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the evil Angel. Can it be doubted here, that <hi>Hermas</hi> intended only to alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorize upon the twofold Inclination in Men towards Good and Evil? It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the <hi>Chaldeans, Jews</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans,</hi> as alſo ſome <hi>Pagan</hi> Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, did affect ſuch like Allegories, and perſonalized theſe two Inclinations. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing was an Angel to the <hi>Jews,</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially with the <hi>Phariſees</hi> when they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted againſt the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> who denied their Exiſtence. As to the Heathens, we have ſhewn before, that the Wiſdom of <hi>Socrates</hi> was his <hi>Demon</hi> and <hi>Genius.</hi> We have ſtumbled at this Oriental Philoſophy which allegorized upon every thing, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualized and perſonalized all. It is by the like Miſtake that <hi>groſs Platoniſm</hi> took literally, what the <hi>ſubtil Platoniſm</hi> ſaid only in Allegory; and made three <hi>Hypoſtaſes</hi> of the three Divine Powers, concurring in the Creation of the World. Now theſe Divines, who turn'd theſe two Inclinations in Man into two Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Perſons, are the ſame that metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſed the Power of God, which crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the World, into a Divine Perſon, a Son begotten of God, and conſubſtantial with his Father. Will you truſt 'em ſtill, and boaſt notwithſtanding of the Acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Penetration of our Age, yet fooliſh enough to be beſotted with all theſe Chimeras? Shall we never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid in a lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe, that by the Word of God or his Command all things were created in the beginning; the Apoſtles ſpake it in a myſtic ſenſe of J. C. who is the Word of the Father which created all things, to wit, in the new Creation, having put all things into a new Form and Order, as well the Angels in Heaven, as the Men here on Earth?</p>
                  <p>It is evident by <hi>Clemens Romanus,</hi> that the Antients made uſe of continual alluſions to the firſt Creation, wherein they ſought for a myſtic ſenſe, in reference to the ſecond, performed by J. C. In his ſecond <hi>Ep. c.</hi> 1. he ſpeaks thus of our
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:200403:37"/>Redemption: <q>When we were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Underſtanding, and worſhipped Stone and Wood, God had pity on us—for he call'd us when we were not in being, and would have us to paſs from no Being into a Being (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>)</q> Without doubt he ſpeaks of the New Creation, and that in Terms as ſtrong as were uſed in reference to the Firſt, cauſing us to paſs from <hi>no Being</hi> into a <hi>Being;</hi> as if we were form'd out of nothing, when we were reformed by the Goſpel. Theſe Terms ſeem to be abſolute; but we ought not to be deceived by them, and will do well if we ſeek here for a comparative ſenſe, conſidering that Authors neglect very often to uſe the Particles denoting this Figure, which ſoften the Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as for example, <hi>As it were, That we may ſay ſo, If I may ſpeak thus.</hi> All may perceive, that if <hi>Clement</hi> had ſaid of J. C. as he might have done, <hi>That he called us when we were not in Being, and made us to exiſt out of Nothing;</hi> theſe Words would have been ſtretched, as if they attributed our Creation out of Nothing to J. C. It would have been ſaid, Behold here J. C. particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, to be <hi>him that calls Things not in being, as if they were.</hi> Now by a ſtronger Inference this ſenſe ought to be given them, ſeeing they were ſpoken of the Father, who is the Creator of Heaven and Earth: yet we muſt agree however herein, for the Scope of the Subject re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it, that they intend only the New Creation; and conſequently muſt own, that when the Sacred Authors and their Diſciples, ſeem to attribute the Creation of all Things to J. C. we have the ſame Reaſon to look on ſuch like Expreſſions as Allegories, which ſet before our Eyes the forming of the New Creature, by Repreſentations drawn from the old Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
                  <p>The ſame <hi>Clement</hi> (<hi>Ep.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 12.) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorizeth upon the Scarlet Rope of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab.</hi> Good Criticks do not queſtion this, tho he ſpeaks as if his Allegoric Senſe were the only true one, for he praiſeth not only the Faith, but alſo the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of this Woman, declaring by it the future Redemption by the Blood of J. C. <q>This Allegory of <hi>Clemens,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cotelier</hi> in his Notes, is approved of by many of great Note, quoting the Fathers that followed him therein.</q> Note, he calls it an Allegory, altho in <hi>Clement</hi> it hath all the Air of a ſimple and natural Senſe. If it be ſo, his Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of a <hi>Phaenix</hi> ought not to ſeem ſo ſtrange to us; it is a Fable containing a great Truth in his Opinion; he makes uſe of it as of an ingenious Allegory, that ſeems to have been made expreſly to repreſent to Men the Doctrine of the Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>As to the reſt, whenever <hi>Clement</hi> doth not allegorize, he explains to us ſimply his Sentiment about the <hi>Word</hi> and the <hi>Trinity.</hi> As to the former, he ſaith in <hi>Chap.</hi> 27. of his <hi>1ſt Ep.</hi> to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> 
                     <q>That God founded all things by the Word of his Power, and that he can deſtroy them by the ſame Word (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>utrobique</hi>)</q> Whence it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the Word in his ſenſe is only the Power and Efficacy of God, by which as he created the World, he can alſo deſtroy it when he pleaſeth. This agrees with the Scriptures ſaying, <hi>By the Word of the Lord were the Heavens made, and all the Hoſt of them by the Breath of his Mouth,</hi> Pſal. 33.6. and that by the ſame Breath he deſtroys the Wicked, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.4. &amp; 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.8. We cannot find here the <hi>Platonic</hi> Ideas of a <hi>Perſonalized Word;</hi> ſo that <hi>Photius</hi> had reaſon to complain (<hi>Bibl. Cod.</hi> 126.) that <hi>Clement</hi> did not ſpeak of J. C. in that ſublime Stile, which is made uſe of when God is ſpoken of His, Simplicity has offended thoſe that love only the high-flown Philoſophy of <hi>Plato.</hi> For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a <hi>Platonic</hi> Chriſtian would never have omitted on ſuch an occaſion, to inculcate that God the Father created all things by his Son, who is his <hi>Word</hi> and eternal
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:200403:37"/>Wiſdom; <hi>Clement</hi> is dumb here, and contents himſelf to attribute the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Power or the Command of God. Elſewhere, when he ſpeaks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly of J. C. he withholds himſelf from giving him any other Excellencies or Titles, than thoſe reſulting from the Offices he poſſeſſeth by the Gift of God, as a Recompence for his Sufferings, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe of an <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Lord,</hi> never quoting any other Paſſages but thoſe that ſerve to this purpoſe. As to his <hi>Trinity,</hi> nothing is more ſimple; for being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to move the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to Concord and Union, he alledgeth this Motive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt: <q>Have we any other but the ſame God, the ſame Chriſt, and the ſame Spirit of Grace ſhed upon us?</q> This is a <hi>Trinity</hi> of a Man truly <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolic, one God, one Meſſiah,</hi> and <hi>one Spirit</hi> ſhed upon the Faithful.</p>

                  <p>FROM theſe Diſciples of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, let us come to the Diſciples of <hi>Plato.</hi> Peruſe the <hi>Platoniſt</hi> Writers, and you'll therein find yet ſome remains of <hi>well contrived Platoniſm.</hi> They, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conceived the <hi>Ideas</hi> and <hi>Archetypes</hi> of all Creatures, which are in the viſible World, to be in the <hi>intelligible</hi> World, did eaſily invent a <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Goſpel, which is the Subſtance and Firſt Form of the <hi>ſenſible</hi> Goſpel; a <hi>Diſtinction</hi> which <hi>Origen</hi> did not fail to make, as he diſtinguiſht between the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary</hi> and <hi>ideal</hi> Word, different from the <hi>ſenſible Word;</hi> and as he expreſſes it in his ſecond <hi>Tom.</hi> on <hi>John:</hi> 
                     <q>A <hi>Word</hi> which was in <hi>God,</hi> and which was as different from that which was made Fleſh, as an Original is from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, Subſtance and Reality from the Shadow.</q> They uſe the Compariſon of an Architect, who has in his Mind the Idea and Plan of a Houſe he intends to build. Whereon, they giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves liberty, find all the Wonders of our Goſpel in the Ideas of the Divine Underſtanding. If in the <hi>ſenſible</hi> Church there be found an Oracle and Interpreter from God, born of the Father by the Holy Ghoſt, making the new Creature by the Power and Wiſdom, which he has received from the Father: To this they make another Anſwer in the <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible</hi> Church, a <hi>Word</hi> proceeding from the Boſom or Underſtanding of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of his Subſtance, who is the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Wiſdom of God, and ſecondary Cauſe of all things ſubſiſting in the World. Take off the veil of Allegory, or rather ſuppoſe all that to be Allegory; and 'tis a rational Philoſophy, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces all to God's eternal Decrees as the prime Cauſe of all exiſtent Beings, but particularly of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who being with reſpect to his <hi>Eſſence</hi> the only Son and <hi>Firſt born of all Creatures,</hi> conſequently is in God's <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> the <hi>Idea,</hi> which God <hi>immediately begets,</hi> whereon all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers depend: He is, I ſay, the nobleſt <hi>Idea,</hi> or as ſome ſpeak, the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as.</hi> And if they found this <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Ideas</hi> and <hi>Decrees</hi> of God, it is not to be wonder'd if they found him alſo in the antient Diſpenſation of Angels, while 'tis not more difficult ſeeing him in thoſe firſt Sketches, than in the Deſign and Idea which God had fram'd of him. Thus far I perceive right <hi>Platoniſm,</hi> I ſee
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:200403:38"/>in it the Foot-ſteps of what it was, when in its Purity; and I at the ſame time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in it fair remains of antient Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, either of the <hi>Jews</hi> or of the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> who delighted in profound Senſes and theological Interpretations. But I no ſooner caſt my eye on thoſe <hi>eternal Subſtances,</hi> conceiv'd as real <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi> thoſe <hi>Emanations</hi> as real <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Generations</hi> as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting <hi>Perſons;</hi> than I ſee only deprav'd <hi>Platoniſm,</hi> as abſurd as the Theology of the Poets, and as unpoliſh'd as the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the moſt ſuperſtitious Vulgar.</p>
                  <p>To make this Truth the more evident, 'twill be neceſſary to ſay ſomewhat of Allegory, and of the uſe which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients made of it. But we muſt, as I promis'd in Page 64. at the ſame time ſhew that Diſciples who ofttimes change their Maſters Method, do nevertheleſs retain certain Remains of the antient Diſcipline, which betrays them, and diſcovers their Innovations: That is, we will ſhew the tracks of the antient manner of allegorizing, even in thoſe very men who have abandon'd the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory of the three <hi>Principles,</hi> and choſen the literal Senſe of three <hi>Hypoſtaſes.</hi> I have already given ſome account of it, which ought to be recall'd to mind by the Reader, to join to what I have farther to ſay thereon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Allegory</hi> is a Figure in Speech, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by one thing is expreſſed, and another intimated, by riſing from the literal to a nobler and more theological Senſe. See <hi>Grotius</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> ch. 1.22. I ſhall not here ſpeak of the Enigmatical Science of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> but come directly to the Philoſophy which is moſt known to us. But before I come to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, I muſt advertiſe my Reader, that if he would be fully inform'd on this Head, he may read all the <hi>5th</hi> Book of the <hi>Stromates</hi> of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus.</hi> I'll content my ſelf with quoting thence the following Words, which give us a general Idea of the Antients Method in the uſe they made of Allegory. <q>All thoſe, ſays that Father, who have treated of Divine Matters, as well <hi>Greeks</hi> as <hi>Barbarians,</hi> concealing the <hi>Principles</hi> of things, wrap'd the Truth in Enigma's, Symbols, Allegories and Metaphors, as intricate as thoſe of the Oracles. — Even the Poets, who learnt Theology of the Prophets (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prophets) did often philoſophize according to the hidden Senſe,</q>

                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>Having made this general Obſervation, I paſs to ſomewhat more particular. A great noiſe has been made in the World of the Opinion of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> concerning the Tranſmigration of Souls. The lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Senſe which has been given to this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, has been almoſt generally receiv'd; and there have been but few Perſons who perceiv'd that it only run on a mere Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legory, thro want of duly reflecting on the Genius of antient Philoſophy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Coelius Secundus Curio</hi> was one of thoſe who ſaw thro the Myſtery of it (<hi>Aranei, p.</hi> 42, &amp;c.) <q>As to the Opinion of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> ſays he, I can never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade my ſelf that that Learned Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher ever came to ſuch a degree of Abſurdity, as to believe, that the Souls of Men paſſed out of one Body into another. Let us not doubt but that he thereby intended to ſignify the Change whereunto <hi>Matter</hi> is ſubject, making it continually paſs from one form to another; a Metamorphoſis which that Philoſopher call'd <hi>Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (Palingeneſiam)</hi> or a <hi>Metempſychoſis,</hi> which, according to him, is nothing but the Tranſmigration of the Spirit infus'd in Matter, and with it tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into all the ſeveral Forms which it puts on.</q> 'Twas the miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Revolution of Souls which made ſome Hereticks ſay, that <hi>Adam</hi>'s Soul had paſs'd into <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in miſapplying ſome Texts of Scripture where <hi>Chriſt</hi> is called the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and which ſuppoſe a kind of Analogy between the one and the other. 'Tis by a like Miſtake that ſome others held that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:200403:38"/>the Soul of <hi>Elias</hi> had paſſed into the Body of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> grounding themſelves on theſe Words, that <hi>John</hi> came in the Spirit and Power of <hi>Elias:</hi> and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending that thoſe Words refer to the Conformity of Zeal and Courage between thoſe two Prophets. But when once the right underſtanding of a mere Figure in Speech comes to be loſt, and the literal Senſe prevails, into what Extravagances are we not capable of falling? Witneſs the monſtrous Doctrine of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, which owes its birth to the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of an Allegory a little ſtrain'd.</p>
                  <p>Again, Have not ſome fallen into a prodigious Error, by literally taking that Expreſſion of the Apoſtle, where he ſays, that <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> was without Father, without Mother, and without Deſcent? Have not Men infer'd from thoſe Words, that <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> was not of the Poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> as other Men are? Some hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuppos'd him a <hi>Celeſtial Man</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantial with the eternal <hi>Son of God,</hi> others that he was an <hi>Angel,</hi> others the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> others the <hi>Son of God</hi> himſelf; and laſtly, others a <hi>Power</hi> ſuperior to the Son of God, from which the Son of God had receiv'd his everlaſting High-Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. I am aſham'd for Chriſtians, when I think with what Superſtition they conſecrate all their Fancies, and make as many Myſteries of them. In ſhort, I might venture to affirm, that the Fable of <hi>Simon</hi> the Magician's flying in the Air, carry'd by Devils, and ſtruck down by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> is no more than a mere Allegory of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Victory over <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> when diſputing together concerning the Unity of God, <hi>the Apoſtle put that Heretick to ſilence,</hi> as the Author of the <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 8. That pompous Deſcription ſignifying nothing more, than that the Evangelical Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city concerning the Unity of God, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd and triumph'd over the too ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Philoſophy of <hi>Simon,</hi> who held di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Perſons in one God.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed: Another fam'd Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Antiquity is that of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtence of Souls. Somebody explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe <hi>Words</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that <hi>the Sons of God came in unto the Daughters of Men,</hi> turn'd that Text into an Allegory, and interpreted it of Souls delighting in being united to Human Bodies. But becauſe he, expreſſing himſelf theologically, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Sons of God <hi>Angels,</hi> that Word deceived many <hi>Platoniſt</hi> Fathers, who took it literally. And thence came that ſo abſurd, yet at the ſame time ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally receiv'd Opinion, that the Angels had Commerce with Women, and that from thoſe monſtrous Copulations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Giants. <hi>Origen</hi> in his <hi>50th</hi> Book againſt <hi>Celſus,</hi> teacheth us the Myſtery of that Allegorical Copulation. <q>Some body, ſays he, (meaning <hi>Philo, de Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant.</hi>) has apply'd that Text of <hi>Moſes</hi> to incorporeal Souls, which he meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically calls the Daughters of Men.</q> It may be the other Fathers were nor ignorant of this ſpiritual Senſe, but they follow'd their manner of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phizing, which was to ſpeak always in ſuch terms as kept the Allegory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd, in order to give the more myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Air to what they ſaid. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuppos'd that the Wits of the firſt rank, for whom they wrote, knew the Secret of it; and as to the Vulgar, their aim was to conceal it from them.</p>
                  <p>After what has been ſaid, how ſhall we know but that they affected the giving an appearance of a real and literal Doctrine to all they have deliver'd to us concerning the <hi>Word?</hi> And whether they have not deſignedly conceal'd from us the Secret of the Allegory, that they might by that majeſtick Out ſide draw the more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and reſpect from the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who love what's wondrous. The Diſtinctions which <hi>Origen</hi> ſo often makes between <hi>intelligible</hi> and <hi>ſenſible,</hi> between <hi>Contemplation</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> between the <hi>Word-God,</hi> which is the Object of <hi>ſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick Minds,</hi> and the <hi>incarnate</hi> and <hi>cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Word,</hi> the Object of vulgar Minds; I ſay, theſe Diſtinctions, and ſome others of like nature, ſcarce leave, room to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:200403:39"/>doubt of it. And indeed he may be confident of it, who conſiders what the ſame <hi>Origen</hi> ſays <hi>(ubi ſupra.)</hi> 
                     <q>By the ſecond God, ſays he, <gap reason="foreign">

That ſo <hi>that Soul,</hi> or <hi>that Word</hi> (for he uſes thoſe two Words indifferently) did, for our ſakes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend on Earth, there to ſuffer Death for us Mortals. Again (<hi>Comment. in Joan. Tom.</hi> 20.)</q> 
                     <q>That this Soul, which was before in God in its Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Fulneſs, was by God ſent into the Womb of <hi>Mary,</hi> there to take a Body; other leſs perfect Souls not having had the ſame Honour.</q> If to this be added his affirming in the <hi>1ſt</hi> and <hi>2d</hi> Tome on the ſame Goſpel, <q>That 'tis only the <hi>uttered Word,</hi>
                     </q> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him can be no other than the Soul of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> 
                     <q>That, I ſay, only this <hi>Word,</hi> and not the <hi>Word-God</hi> was incarnate;</q> it cannot be doubted but that by this Soul <hi>ſent, deſcended</hi> and <hi>incarnate,</hi> he means the ſame thing which he and others ſay, when they ſpeak of a <hi>Word ſent, deſcended</hi> and <hi>incarnate.</hi> And what can this <hi>Reaſon</hi> be which it merited, and which was united to it? When the Veil of Allegory is taken off, it can be no other than that high Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, whereof the Soul of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had by its pre-exiſtent Obedience render'd it ſelf capable; or than that degree of Prophecy, and that Spirit without meaſure, wherewith God had honoured it, and which made it Partaker of the Divine Nature; or laſtly, the very Office of <hi>Word</hi> or of <hi>Interpreter</hi> of God, whereof God had judged it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, as the moſt perfect and nobleſt of the Spirits, which he had decreed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his Mind. <q>
                        <hi>Celſus,</hi> ſays he, (<hi>ibid. lib.</hi> 7.) will not own that he who ſuffer'd Death can be worthy of the ſecond Honours next to the Supreme God, as well becauſe of the Powers he had acquir'd in Heaven, as becauſe of thoſe he had acquir'd on Earth.</q> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, as you ſee, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had merited in Heaven before he came to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit on our Earth, he was very far from believing him to be the moſt High God.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, <hi>Origen</hi> having ſaid of the <hi>Word,</hi> that it <hi>was in God,</hi> that it <hi>came from God,</hi> that it was <hi>made Fleſh;</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the ſame of the Soul of <hi>J. C.</hi> this Conformity yields juſt reaſon to ſuſpect, that the Doctrine of the <hi>Word</hi> is nothing but the <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> theologiz'd, whereon they diſcours'd Allegorically. That's in a manner prov'd by the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis of the <hi>Arians,</hi> who believ'd that the <hi>Word</hi> was to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> inſtead of a Soul; and conſequently by the <hi>Word</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood only the Soul of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> created before all Ages: An Hypotheſis renew'd in our time by <hi>John Turner,</hi> who has given it a new turn; for he maintains, <q>That the <hi>Word</hi> is nothing elſe but the <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> created indeed, but eternally united to the Subſtance of God, and by that Union partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating all his Perfections.</q> 
                     <hi>A Diſcourſe concerning the Meſſiah,</hi> Ep. Dedic. p. 154.</p>
                  <p>The ſame is infer'd from the Uſe which has been made of ſome Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as, for example, theſe: <hi>I came from the Father. O Father, glorify me with the Glory which I had with thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Who being in the Form of God,</hi> &amp;c. Our Divines interpret them of the Pre-exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the <hi>Word;</hi> but <hi>Origen,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Ruſt,</hi> in his Book intitul'd, <hi>Origen and his chief Opinions,</hi> interpret them of the Pre-exiſtence of the Soul of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Whence comes this Confuſion of Ideas? The reaſon of it is eaſily given: The
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:200403:39"/>former of theſe Interpretations is my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious and allegorical, and the latter literal. So we may conclude that the Fathers allegoriz'd on the pre-exiſtent Soul of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> loving our Nature, and becoming incarnate for our Salvation; which they in their allegorical Stile, call'd the <hi>Word,</hi> or the <hi>Son of God.</hi> And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, thoſe who take this laſt Allegory in the literal Senſe, and underſtand it of a Divine Perſon united to our Fleſh, are not leſs ridioulous than they who, ſtumbling at the Letter of the firſt Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, really believ'd that Angels had mix'd themſelves with mortal Women. The Text for the firſt Hypotheſis, that the <hi>Sons of God were married to the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Men,</hi> ſerves as well as that for the ſecond, <hi>I have begotten thee before the Morning.</hi>

                  <p>This Pre-exiſtence of Souls, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of that of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> has been very antient in the Church.

Theſe are his Words: <q>As you have been call'd (dwelling) in the Fleſh, ſo you will come in the Fleſh. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Lord, who ſav'd us, being the firſt Spirit (<gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> likewiſe we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Recompence in the Fleſh.</q> This Paſſage ſuppoſes the Pre-exiſtence of our Souls, as well as that of the Soul of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> For he compares our Spirits exiſting in the Fleſh, to that firſt Spirit which was made Fleſh to call us. He calls <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> of all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, whether Souls or Angels, becauſe God begat him firſt a little before he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the Creation of the World, and afterwards imploy'd him to create the other Spirits, according to the Doctrine of <hi>Lactantius</hi> (<hi>Inſtit. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 6.) who further teaches us (<hi>ibid. c.</hi> 1.2.) That this Holy Spirit deſcending from Heaven, choſe the Womb of a Virgin to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And the better to carry on the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon which he makes of that Spirit to all incarnate Spirits, he ſhews that he was rais'd to the Recompence only by his faithful Obedience and Vertue (<hi>ibid. cap.</hi> 14.) His Words are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable; <q>God, ſays he, having ſent his Son to Men — He hath ſhewn his Faithfulneſs in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that there is but one God, and that he only is to be worſhip'd: and he never call'd himſelf God, becauſe he would have violated his Truth, if being ſent to take away from the World the Plurality of Gods, and to eſtabliſh the Unity of God, he had introduc'd more than one God. That had not been preaching One God, nor working for the Intereſt of him who ſent him, but for his own; and it would have been dividing himſelf from the Father, whom he came to glorify. Then by his having been thus faithful, and in the Deſign of diſcharging his Commiſſion not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing any thing to himſelf; he has receiv'd the Dignity of everlaſting High Prieſt, the Honour of Supreme King, the Power of Judg, and the Name of God.</q> By the way, theſe Words of this Father are a curious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe on thoſe of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 2.6, &amp;c. <hi>Who being in the Form of God, did not attribute to himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him; and hath given him a Name which is above every Name,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Let us here remember a diſtinction of the Fathers, which has been mention'd already, and wherein the Footſteps of antient Allegory viſibly appear. The Fathers diſtinguiſh'd two kinds of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Word,</hi> the one eternal and <hi>internal,</hi> and the other <hi>external,</hi> which began with the World, and the only one which they properly call Generation. Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> acknowledgeth this diſtinction; only he pretends (but without reaſon) that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the latter which is <hi>metaphorical.</hi> Granting him his deſire, 'tis the ſame thing with reſpect to the Queſtion now treated of: For it remains nevertheleſs
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:200403:40"/>true, that they allegoriz'd on one of the Generations of the <hi>Word,</hi> be it which it will, and that's all I need. Let them, as long as they pleaſe, ſay that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſpake of a <hi>Generation</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> which was proper and literal: I ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Yes, and that's what I call groſs <hi>Platoniſm,</hi> which has made them philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophize ſo abſurdly. But by their own confeſſion, the ſame Fathers have ſpoken of another Generation of the <hi>Word,</hi> which is <hi>metaphorical</hi> and <hi>allegorical,</hi> and that's what I call their refin'd <hi>Platoniſm,</hi> the fair Remains of ſound Philoſophy; which betrays them, and manifeſtly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the abſurdity of the other part of their Syſtem, whereon they have inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated.</p>
                  <p>He muſt know little of <hi>Plato,</hi> who can believe that he could fall into ſo dull a Philoſophy, as that God did from all Eternity neceſſarily beget a Son, a ſecond God, putting him forth out of himſelf, with his proper Hypoſtaſis, which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth him from the Father; and that he made uſe of him to create the World; unleſs 'twere perhaps to deceive the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar People. But that God did volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily conceive a Deſign of creating the World; that he did actually create it by his efficacious Word; that that Word is his Son in an allegorical Senſe, becauſe it was emanated from the Divine Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; that it was in an allegorical ſenſe the Creator, becauſe it was the Means and Inſtrument which the Wiſdom of God made uſe of to give Life and Being to all things: Then indeed I own literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaying, that <hi>God ſpake, and the Creature obey'd:</hi> then I ſhall own <hi>Plato</hi>'s Allegory telling me the ſame thing with <hi>Moſes,</hi> but in the Stile of the Religion wherein he was born: Then, to conclude, I own the good Divinity of <hi>Clemens A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandrinus,</hi> who aſſures me that the <hi>Word</hi> of the Father is not that which was begotten, but ſupreme Goodneſs, profound Wiſdom, and infinite Power manifeſting it ſelf in the Work of this Univerſe. This is, without doubt, the true way of underſtanding <hi>Plato,</hi> and we have a famous <hi>Platoniſt</hi> as our Warrant for it; 'tis <hi>Coelius Rhodoginus</hi> (<hi>Lect. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 12.) For that Great Man very judiciouſly obſerves, that <hi>one can never be a good</hi> Platoniſt, <hi>if he do not reckon that</hi> Plato <hi>is to be underſtood allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Good <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> like the Author of the <hi>Recognitions,</hi> diſcover to us the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of this allegorical Philoſophy, by ſaying, <q>That from the firſt Will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded another Will, and from this the World,</q> (<hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 24.) That is to ſay, that from the <hi>firſt</hi> eternal and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally begotten <hi>Will,</hi> proceeded at the beginning of all things, a <hi>ſecond Will,</hi> externally begotten, an expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which ſpoken, all things were made. And this <hi>ſecond Will</hi> is metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically the <hi>Son,</hi> becauſe proceeding from God himſelf, and from the Inviſibility which is proper to his Nature, it is a kind of Generation producing his Image; every Manifeſtation being the Image of God. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> is alſo another of the good <hi>Platoniſts</hi> who allegoriz'd. In ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places of his Treatiſe againſt Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, he ſuppoſes God not to have needed any more than his two Hands to create the World. There's no difficulty in perceiving his intention thro thoſe Words. Whereas the Hereticks main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd that all was made by Angels, and that thoſe Spirits had created the World: <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in oppoſing that Doctrine, flies into the oppoſite extreme, <hi>viz.</hi> That God, who had no need of Angels, made uſe of no more than his two Hands, his <hi>Word</hi> and his <hi>Spirit,</hi> to do all things; not that by thoſe two Powers he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood two <hi>Hypoſtaſes,</hi> but only perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd them in oppoſition to the <hi>Aeons,</hi> or to the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> Angels, which were eſteemed Perſons. And he meant no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than that God needed not any other than himſelf (as he explains himſelf in the <hi>19th</hi> Chapter of his firſt Book) and in no wiſe any Power ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from him, having an Hypoſtaſis
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:200403:40"/>diſtinct from his: This God, ſays he, is the Father of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>—What do theſe words ſignify, That God needed no other than himſelf, if not that God had no need of any more than his Command and Power to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate what he will'd? Now this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and this Power are not two <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſes</hi> ſeparate and diſtinct from his (which was the Opinion of thoſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks) but two Powers, which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd as his two Hands: Either let's blind our ſelves, or ſee Allegory in all this. Again, it's by a common Figure, that the Name, the Qualities, and even the Perſonality of the thing which ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be, or which is rejected, is given to that which takes its place, tho it be of a different nature. God rejecting Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, gives the name of Sacrifice to the Obedience which he accepts. <q>There is nothing more natural (ſays Dr. <hi>A.</hi> in his Manuſcript concerning the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction) than to give to a thing which ſupplies the place of another, and which procures all the fruits of it, the Name of that inſtead whereof it is ſubſtituted. St. <hi>Paul</hi> obſerv'd this Rule in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> If he gave the Name of Sacrifice to the Obedience of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> it was to ſute his Expreſſions to the Ideas which prevail'd under the antient Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, wherein the principal Acts of Piety conſiſted in Sacrifices; he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied thoſe antient Sacrifices to the Death of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> without intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any other Myſtery in it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereto may be added, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> who was to teach the Truth by his Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as he himſelf had taught it by Preaching, ſpeaks of him as of a Teacher, as of a Perſon, becauſe he was to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the abſence of a Teacher, and fill the place of a Perſon. So, as the <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks</hi> ſpake of nothing but Angels who had created the World, and govern'd the antient People, and of Emanations and Generations from the Supreme Being: <hi>Irenaeus</hi> anſwers, The true Angels which created the World, and taught the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, are the <hi>Word</hi> of God and his <hi>Spirit;</hi> and that <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> are his true Emanations: So making of a Manifeſtation and of a Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, God's Helpers, his Coadjutors in the Creation, his Miniſters in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World; making, I ſay, ſo many <hi>Hypoſtaſes</hi> of the Godhead, of thoſe Powers, becauſe he ſubſtitutes them in lieu of the <hi>Hypoſtaſes</hi> rejected by him.</p>
                  <p>It is by the fame method that <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> made intirely allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Commentarys on the four Goſpels. Thus he allegorizes the firſt words of St. <hi>John:</hi> 
                     <q>The <hi>Beginning,</hi> ſays he, that is God: The <hi>Word,</hi> that is, the Son of God, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> of whom the Voice of the Father ſaith in the Pſalm, <hi>My Heart hath uttered a good Word,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by whom all things were made: <hi>And without him nothing was made; Nothing,</hi> that is to ſay, an <hi>Idol,</hi> which, as the Apoſtle ſaith, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World.</q> It is apparent by the Method of this Author, who deſigns the explaining the Goſpels allegorically, and particularly by the allegorical Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he gives of the word <hi>Beginning,</hi> and of that of <hi>Nothing,</hi> that what he ſays of the <hi>Word</hi> is likewiſe allegorical. The <hi>Word,</hi> ſays he, is the Son of God, that is to ſay, the Chriſt, by whom all things were made. Is not that ſaying that it is the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Man whom God hath anointed, who is the <hi>Son</hi> and the <hi>Word,</hi> by whoſe Power all under the Goſpel was made? even the <hi>Idol,</hi> which was made without him, having been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, and the World reform'd. Let us deal plainly, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>Word</hi> only by virtue of an allegorical Senſe, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders him as a <hi>ſecond Word,</hi> in as much as he is with reſpect to the ſpiritual World, what the <hi>Word-God</hi> was with reſpect to the ſenſible World.</p>

                     <q>What a pitiful Argument that is!

                     </q> This Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor gives us to underſtand, that what diſtinguiſhes <hi>Adam</hi> from other Animals, or <hi>J. Chriſt</hi> from <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf, is not ſo much the Miracle of their Birth, which ſeems to be every way equal, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of thoſe Giſts, which they more or leſs receiv'd by that extraordinary Birth: And thoſe degrees of Excellence are ſhewn by the <hi>Breath of God</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Noſtrils, and by the Operation of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in the Conception of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> That <hi>Divine Breath</hi> raiſing <hi>Adam</hi> above all other Animals; and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> being doubtleſs ſomething more noble than that <hi>Breath,</hi> hath raiſed <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> above the firſt Man, and made him the <hi>Son of God</hi> in a more proper and more peculiar manner. So we are likewiſe to argue on the Exaltation of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſhew that it raiſes him infinitely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>Enoch,</hi> not by the mere Miracle of raiſing him to Heaven, but by the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power which was then communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to him.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall we ſay of <hi>Origen?</hi> We might copy his whole Works. Read on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his firſt <hi>Tome</hi> on St. <hi>John,</hi> where he ſtrongly diſputes againſt the <hi>Valentinians.</hi> 1. In ſhewing them, that ſince they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the other Names given to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as the <hi>Life,</hi> the <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Light,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>anagogically</hi> and <hi>allegorically</hi> (they are his own Terms) it is but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that they keep to the ſame Rule in interpreting the Name of <hi>Word,</hi> and give it an allegorical and figurative Senſe. <q>'Tis not reaſonable, ſays he to them, that you will not expound the Term <hi>Word</hi> in a metaphorical Senſe, while you allegorically explain that other Phraſe, <hi>the Light of the World.</hi> — Therefore ſince <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is call'd the <hi>Light,</hi> becauſe of his Work or Office, which is to enlighten the World, it follows that he is alſo call'd the <hi>Word,</hi> becauſe of his <hi>Work,</hi> which is to cure us of our Errors and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, to prepare us to act conformably to Truth and Reaſon.</q> Nothing can be more juſt than this Obſervation of <hi>Origen.</hi> St. <hi>John</hi>'s Stile is altogether Oriental, full of harſh Metaphors, hyperbolical Expreſſions, and very peculiar manners of ſpeaking. 'Tis however impoſſible for one freed from Prejudices to miſtake them. How? Why, every Man whoſe Head's not fill'd with mad <hi>Platoniſm,</hi> will not look for more Myſtery in the Term <hi>Word,</hi> than in thoſe of <hi>Light, Way, Life</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> &amp;c. Titles which the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt no leſs attributes to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> than the former. Indeed if this Divine Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is the <hi>Light</hi> and the <hi>Truth,</hi> becauſe he is the bearer of a Doctrine which diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates our Darkneſs and Errors; if he is the <hi>Way</hi> and the <hi>Life,</hi> becauſe he opens to us the way of attaining everlaſting Happineſs: why may we not argue in the ſame manner on this other Term <hi>Word?</hi> And why ſhould we not ſay that <hi>J. Chriſt</hi> is ſo called, becauſe he is the Bearer of the Word of God by way of Excellence, and the Interpreter of his moſt authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Truths?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Origen</hi> endeavours to take from the <hi>Valentinians</hi> two Paſſages in the 33d and <hi>45th</hi> Pſalms, which they made uſe of to prove that the term <hi>Word</hi> had no other Signification than that of <hi>Prolation,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called. For he ſuppoſes that theſe Words, <hi>My Heart hath utter'd a good Word,</hi> do not ſignify ſuch a <hi>Prolation,</hi> a proper and literal Generation, but a <hi>metaphorical Prolation:</hi> and that from this reaſon, that the word <hi>Heart</hi> in this Text being figurative, the term <hi>Word</hi> muſt alſo be figurative. And that we may the better apprehend how far <hi>Origen</hi> carrys the Figure of this Word, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Text which he quotes from the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> ſo fully clears the matter, as to leave no room for cavilling. <q>The <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinians,</hi> ſays he, believe that theſe Words, <hi>The Heavens were created by the Word of God, and by the Spirit of his Mouth,</hi> were ſaid of our <hi>Saviour</hi> and of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> tho it be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that one may give them this other Senſe, That the Heavens were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:200403:42"/>by Divine Reaſon and Wiſdom <hi>(ratione Dei)</hi> as we ſay that a Houſe was built by that Skill which is the Art of building Houſes.</q> I leave the Reader to judg whether an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> could more plainly remove all the Idea of <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> from our Minds. Therefore when the ſame <hi>Origen</hi> does elſewhere ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue concerning the <hi>Word,</hi> as if he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf believ'd it an <hi>Hypoſtaſis,</hi> his ſo ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was according to the Principles of the <hi>Greek</hi> Philoſophy. For, as <hi>Porphyry</hi> right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerves, <hi>Origen</hi> having continually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd himſelf to reading the Writings of the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> and the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> and having therein learnt the allegorical way of thoſe Philoſophers expounding the Myſteries of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> made uſe of it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his Interpretation of the Scriptures (<hi>apud Euſeb. l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 19.) See likewiſe <hi>Bibl. univ. T.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 50. That declared Enemy of the Chriſtian Religion is not the only Perſon who has given that judgment of <hi>Origen:</hi> Mr. <hi>Huet</hi> does not treat him more favourably in his <hi>Origeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana, l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <q>
                        <hi>Origen,</hi> ſays he, was one of <hi>Plato</hi>'s greateſt Admirers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that inſtead of ſuting the <hi>Platonick</hi> Tenents to the Chriſtian Doctrine, he regulated the Doctrine of Chriſtianity by the Dogma of the <hi>Platoniſts.</hi>
                     </q> And a little lower he adds, <q>That <hi>Origen</hi> had been carry'd to thoſe Exceſſes by the example of his Preceptor <hi>Clemens Alexand.</hi> who us'd to embeliſh the Religion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> with the Academick Paint.</q>

                  <p>Can any one think that <hi>Juſtin</hi> did not diſcourſe by the Principles of this <hi>Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical</hi> Philoſophy, when in his ſecond Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy he calls the Reaſon which is in Man, a Part and Seed, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>of the Divine Word?</hi> The Divine Word is in his ſenſe, only that univerſal Reaſon, that Source and Fulneſs of Wiſdom-which reſides in the Divine Underſtanding, whereof ours is a Stream and a part. Is our Reaſon an Hypoſtaſis diſtinct from Man? How ſhall we then imagine that this Father ever intended to ſay that Divine Reaſon is an <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> diſtinct from God? I may very well ſay that my Reaſon has taught me ſuch a thing, and that I conſulted my Reaſon, without ſuppoſing my Reaſon to be any other Perſon than my ſelf. Then why may we not ſay God made uſe of his Reaſon to create this Univerſe, that his Reaſon was his Counſellor and his Miniſter, without making a ſecond Perſon of his Reaſon? Certainly my Reaſon cannot be perſonalized, any otherwiſe than by the Power of Allegory, neither can that of God be any otherwiſe. Nay, it may be that <hi>Juſtin</hi> ſtrain'd his Allegory yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that he intended to ſay, that Reaſon, or the univerſal Seed, is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Goſpel; which is not a part of the Seed, as the Precepts of Reaſon which enlighten'd the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers are, but the fulneſs of that incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Seed which regenerates the Heart.</p>
                  <p>I will produce another Example of this allegorical way of interpreting the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> explaining that famous Paſſage of St. <hi>John</hi> (1 Ep. 5.8.) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the three Witneſſes on Earth, the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Water,</hi> and the <hi>Blood,</hi> has ſpoken of them, as of the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which are the three Witneſſes in Heaven, now found in our Bibles, but were not there in the days of that Father. Some, as <hi>Fulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> having confounded St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the Sacred Text, did not doubt but that Holy Martyr had ſpoken literally, and as words of the Scripture, what he ſaid only in Allegory; not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, that what he aſſerted of the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Senſe which he had drawn from the Three Witneſſes on Earth; as if the <hi>Spirit</hi> were the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Blood</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Water</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> But <hi>Facundus</hi> did not ſuffer himſelf to be at all deceiv'd by it, for he informs us (<hi>Defenſ. Trinit. Capit. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 3.) <q>That St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> will have that to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:200403:42"/>the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which St. <hi>John</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Spirit, Water</hi> and <hi>Blood;</hi>
                     </q> which can be only an allegorical Interpretation. And that Allegory was followed by St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> (<hi>contra Maxim. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 12.) where he expreſly ſays, <q>That the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> the <hi>Water</hi> and the <hi>Blood,</hi> are the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                     </q> What's the meaning of the <hi>Sacrament?</hi> if it be not the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery and Allegory. Now, I pray, who can warrant me that the Fathers, who ſo ſtrained the Allegory on the three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes on Earth, to find the Trinity therein, have not alſo ſtrained it on the <hi>Word</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi> to find in it their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite Doctrine, <hi>Plato</hi>'s ſecond God? If they miſapplyed theſe Words, <hi>My Heart hath uttered a Good Word,</hi> and theſe <hi>I have begotten thee in my Boſom before Aurora;</hi> how can I be aſſur'd that they have not deceived me, or that their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuation for <hi>Plato</hi> has not deceived themſelves, when they Platonically in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret thoſe other Places, where it is ſaid, <hi>That the Word was God,</hi> and <hi>that the Word was made Fleſh?</hi>

                  <p>However that be, it muſt be granted me, That the Fathers made no difficulty of ſeeking ſublime ſenſes in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and of raiſing themſelves up very high above its plain and natural meaning. That appears by the uſe St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> made of the Epiſtle General of St. <hi>John.</hi> Now the ſame Fathers having expreſſed their Allegories in too abſolute Terms, without characterizing them by ſome Mark, whereby they might be diſtinguiſhed from a proper and lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe, it has in ſucceeding time hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that the literal ſenſe of what they ſaid has been followed. We have ſeen it in the Example of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that Father expreſſing himſelf abſolutely: <q>It is written, ſays he, of the <hi>Father,</hi> of the <hi>Son,</hi> and of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt, And theſe three are one.</hi>
                     </q> Now that was written only of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and the <hi>Blood.</hi> Then the Allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Expoſition has been taken for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Text of Scripture. I ſtrongly ſuſpect that the ſame thing has happen'd to that noted Text of St. <hi>Paul</hi> (1 <hi>Tim. c.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 16.) <hi>The Myſtery of Godlineſs is great, God manifeſted in the Fleſh.</hi> It's well known, that the Latin Church has always read, <hi>which</hi> was manifeſted in the Fleſh. We may be well aſſured, that the whole <hi>Greek</hi> Church did not read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, by <hi>Gelazius</hi> of <hi>Cizicus</hi>'s putting this Reading into the Mouths of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council. He ſays, that <hi>Macarius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the Argument of a Philoſopher, cited this Paſſage of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> But how? In the ſame manner as we read it in the <hi>Vulgar Latin, The Myſtery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is great, which was manifeſted in the Fleſh</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) But that Father not fully ſatisfied with the Letter of the Text, added this Gloſs, that is to ſay, <hi>The Son of God,</hi> a perfectly Spiritual Expoſition, which being ſince ſlid into the Text, gave birth to our preſent Reading, <hi>God manifeſted in the Fleſh.</hi> And here an Allegorical Expoſition is again taken for an expreſs Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>It is the ſame with the <hi>Word:</hi> ſome one having allegorized, according to the Cuſtom of that time, on the Words of <hi>Moſes, And God ſaid,</hi> or on thoſe of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>My Heart hath uttered a good Word,</hi> or on thoſe of St. <hi>John, In the beginning was the Word,</hi> &amp;c. and having expreſſed his Allegory in too ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Terms, there needed no more to Men prepoſſeſſed with falſe Platoniſm, to make them regard ſuch an allegorical Expoſition as the Doctrine of the Church. The ſame thing that happen'd among the Hereticks, has alſo fallen out among thoſe who call themſelves Orthodox. And we need not wonder that the ſame <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,</hi> which both the one and the other made profeſſion of, caſt them both into the ſame Wandrings. This is what I mean, and my Conjecture comes near to Demonſtration. We have ſeen that <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine</hi> a great Sectary of <hi>Plato,</hi> having
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:200403:43"/>allegoriz'd on Divine Ideas and Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, and having ſpoken of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Fiction of as many Perſons, his Diſciples not underſtanding his Allegory, made Perſonal Subſtances of thoſe feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Perſons. If <hi>Valentine</hi>'s Followers miſunderſtood the ſenſe of their Maſter, can we doubt but that the ſame thing happened to the <hi>Platoniſt</hi> Fathers, in their miſapprehending the allegorical way of philoſophizing uſed by their Predeceſſors, and in converting mere Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Manifeſtations into Perſonal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances? For my part I do not at all doubt of their having imitated each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Doctors of both ſides had at the ſame time the ſame <hi>Ideas, viz.</hi> the Principles of refin'd <hi>Platoniſm,</hi> delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Allegory and the Fiction of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: And the Diſciples of each Party at the ſame time chang'd their Maſters Ideas, and fell into groſs <hi>Platoniſm,</hi> which finds <hi>Hypoſtaſes</hi> in every thing. Whatever Party Men happened to be ingag'd in, they rarely miſs following the then prevailing Philoſophy, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves to the Humour and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of that Age. When Allegory was in vogue, all as well Orthodox as Hereticks allegoriz'd, each with reference to his own Syſtem, ſome under the Fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Three Aeons,</hi> and others under that of Thirty. So alſo when <hi>groſs Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſm</hi> had prevailed, all delighted in <hi>Hypoſtaſes,</hi> and follow'd the Philoſophy in faſh on. 'Tis the Fate of <hi>Hypoſtaſes,</hi> the Hamour of the Age regulates them. Thus <hi>refined Platoniſm</hi> degenerated into <hi>groſs Platoniſm,</hi> and allegorical Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into a groſs literal Senſe. It often happening, that Diſciples much miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their Maſters, or go further than they to ſay ſomething new. But, to conclude, which way ſoever Innovation begins, it paſſes in very little time from Sect to Sect; Heathens, Hereticks, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, all embrace the new Method. Their Doctrines are different, but their manner of philoſophizing on thoſe Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines is alike and uniform. Perhaps they may not agree in the Nature of what they call Principles, nor in their Names, Number or Order, nor on their Age or Excellence, nor in their other Qualities and Prerogatives: but however it be with theſe, they ſhall all agree that they are <hi>Hypoſtaſes, Perſonal Subſtances,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Philoſophy of the Age re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> A Digreſſion concerning the pretended unalterable Faith of the Church.</head>
                  <p>TIS pretended that the Church is ſo faithful a Guardian of <hi>the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> that it cannot be liable to theſe ſorts of Changes. But one muſt have a ſlender Acquaintance with Antiquity, and leſs Experience of what happens e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, to deceive ones ſelf with ſo wretched an Anſwer. The Church is jealous of certain Terms, and ſhe is a faithful Repoſitory; that's agreed. But provided one does not meddle with the Terms, which ſhe holds ſacred and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olable; one may change the Hypotheſes as much as one pleaſes, and they have been changed with Impunity, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving much Trouble <hi>to the Church.</hi> Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> hold two Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes, directly oppoſite to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for the firſt urges ſo ſtrongly the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of God, that he loſes the <hi>Trinity
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:200403:43"/>of Perſons;</hi> and the latter willing to maintain the <hi>Trinity,</hi> has quite loſt the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi> One of theſe two, no matter which, has changed <hi>the Tradition.</hi> Let the Church ſpeak therefore, and declare herſelf if ſhe can, for one of theſe Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes. Let her condemn and anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize the other; let her chaſtize the Authors of it, and caſt them out of her Boſom. No, ſhe will nor do it, ſhe is not concerned whither a falſe Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis may lead her, provided it does not change her Terms which are Sacred, and her Favourites. For inſtance, ſuppoſe that it has always been believed hitherto, that three Perſons ſignify but three Modes, or three Relations, or three Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You may ſay notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, without fearing the <hi>good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron</hi> will formally declare himſelf, that three Perſons are no leſs than three Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and three Beings, provided you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Terms ſhe uſes in her Prayers; and ſay devoutly with her, <hi>O holy, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and glorious Trinity, three Perſons and one God, have Mercy upon us miſerable Sinners.</hi> The Reaſon is plainly this, ſhe is very quick at hearing, if you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce theſe Words, <hi>one God and three Perſons.</hi> But with what Modeſty will ſhe judg of the ſenſe of thoſe Terms, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no certain Idea for 'em? If inſtead of three Perſons I ſay four or five, the Church will declare me an Heretick, this is all ſhe can do. In ſhort, whether theſe three Perſons are <hi>three Modes</hi> or <hi>three diſtinct Subſtances,</hi> this is a Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, too nice and curious for the Church's Deciſion; and as to this, ſhe leaves all her Children to their Liberty of believing as they can. The Church has been always the ſame without doubt; ſhe might condemn as Here<gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">

                     </gap>, thoſe who reckoned thirty Perſons or thirty Aeons in the Divine Eſſence, as the <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks</hi> did: But for others, who did but change three feigned and allegorical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, into three perſonal Subſtances; ſhe has let them alone, or rather ſhe has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them as her dear Children, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate and ſure her to the prevailing Philoſophy, the better to draw into her Communion the groſſeſt <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> who made a great Figure in the Schools.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iſaac Voſſius</hi> in his ſecond Letter to <hi>Rivet</hi> goes farther, and ventures to ſay, that <hi>the Church</hi> made no difficulty even of tolerating the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> that is, the Doctrine of them, <hi>who held thirty Perſons in the Deity,</hi> and that ſhe admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them into her Communion. She had more Indulgence than I ſhould have: <q>The firſt Chriſtians, ſays <hi>Voſſius,</hi> did not preſently caſt Hereticks out of her Communion, they came not to that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity; but did it when the Hereticks went ſo far, as expreſly to contradict the Chriſtian Faith. As to others, who did but <hi>alter</hi> the Truths of the Goſpel, by mixing with them the <hi>Gentile</hi> Fables, they dealt not ſo rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly with them, but allow'd them ſome kind of Liberty.</q> He puts down <hi>Valentinian</hi> among theſe laſt; whence it follows, that if the thirty Aeons of <hi>that Heretick</hi> were tolerated, there would have been no difficulty to admit of <hi>three Hypoſtaſes,</hi> inſtead of <hi>three Attributes</hi> or three Modes. Theſe good Men thought it not amiſs, to accommodate the Truths of the Goſpel with the Fables of the Pagan Philoſophers and Poets, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Service to Religion. Hence it was, without doubt, that <hi>Platoniſm,</hi> which at firſt ſerved her only for Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at length became, under favour of this Toleration, the very Support of her Myſteries.</p>
                  <p>This brings to my remembrance a Remark of Monſ. <hi>Le Clere</hi> in his Rules of Criticiſm (<hi>Biblioth. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niv. Tom.</hi> 10. <hi>p.</hi> 334.) which very well deſerves our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection. <q>It has ſo fallen out, that tho there have been always in uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians ſome certain Terms, yet they have inſenſibly departed widely from <hi>their</hi> Ideas, which they who firſt uſed the Terms fixed to them: and tho the Words remain the ſame, yet the Senſe of them has
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:200403:44"/>paſſed thro divers Revolutions. The Phraſes or Expreſſions being, ſays he, written in ſenſible Characters in a great many Books, could not ſuffer any great Alteration: but the Ideas (firſt belonging to thoſe Expreſſions) being things not to be ſeen with ones Eyes; and their Riſe and Diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and their ſeveral Changes, being all ſecret things within the Mind of every Man, and inviſible to every body elſe; 'tis hard to gueſs what has happened, by the means of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal Sound. One ſees on a Theater the Actors come forth from behind the Curtains in certain Habits; may one therefore conclude, that always when one ſees the ſame Habits, they are the ſame Actors who have them on? 'Tis the ſame with Thoughts, and the Words wherein they are dreſſed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In theſe Words you have an account as it were, of the Comedy our <hi>Trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> act at this day. They put on all the Dreſſes of the Church, and ſay with her, <hi>Holy Bleſſed and Glorious Trinity, three Perſons and one God.</hi> But does it follow therefore, that under the ſame Words they conceive the ſame Ideas; or that they are the ſame Actors always, when ſeen in the ſame Habits? Not at all Some are <hi>Sabellians,</hi> others are <hi>Rigid,</hi> and others are <hi>moderate Trinitarians;</hi> and all together have Ideas ſo confus'd, and ſo contrary to one another, that it may be one ſhould not, be much miſtaken, if one ſaid that this Expreſſion [three-Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons] in their Mouths has as many ſenſes; as there are Divines who pronounce <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> if it be true that they ſix any meaning to them, and that they form any Ideas about them. So that, altho the <hi>Blato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have uſed theſe Terms, yet it does not follow thereupon that they had the ſame Ideas, nor that the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> had the ſame among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; nor that all Chriſtians among themſelves, in all Times and Places, affix'd to the ſame Terms one conſtant, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Signification. The preſent Time ſufficiently ſhews us what one ought to judg of the paſt: The <hi>Terms,</hi> have been always the ſame, but they are only ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Objects that are not <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to change; but the Meaning and the Ideas being things inviſible, which paſs within the Mind, they may be, and are changed without being perceived. To conclude, I make this Reflection only with regard to metaphyſical Terms, whereof we have but unſteady and confus'd Ideas, and by conſequence they are liable to very great Alterations. As theſe Ideas do not enter into our Minds without difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo they are not maintained there with a little Pains; ſooner or later they vaniſh, and after all, they cannot paſs from the Maſter's Mouth to the Scholar's Ear without ſome Revolutions: The U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of God is one thing with a <hi>Jew,</hi> and another with the <hi>Trinitarian.</hi> The Term [Conſubſtantial] with the <hi>Samoſatenians</hi> carrys a different Idea with it in the Mind from that of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers. Three Hypoſtaſes have one ſenſe with the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> and another with the <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> one with the Followers of <hi>Arius,</hi> and another among <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And certainly the Fathers of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> had reaſon to give this Advice to them at <hi>Antioch,</hi> in the Letter they writ to them (<hi>apud Athan. vid. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin. Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 138.) <q>That they ſhould not differ among themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Hypoſtaſes, ſince they who owned three in the Trinity, and they who allowed of no more than one; are both of the ſame Opinion, and differed only in the manner of their Expreſſion.</q> We underſtand well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough what this means, the metaphyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Terms are capable of the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory ſenſe, one may make them, as we make the Clock, ſtrike what we pleaſe. If you own three Hypoſtaſes, you are Orthodox; if you acknowledg but one, you are ſtill ſo nevertheleſs. This Term is a ſort of <hi>Prote is,</hi> that takes in all ſenſes. In ſome mens mouths it ſignifies <hi>the manner of ſubſiſting,</hi> and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:200403:44"/>then 'tis <hi>three;</hi> with others it ſignifies <hi>Subſtance,</hi> and then 'tis but <hi>one.</hi> You ſee here both are ſound to be of the ſame mind, before they are aware. Alas! I really think that I and the Church ſhall be of the ſame mind too, if when ſhe owns <hi>one Eſſence and three Perſons,</hi> I ſhould ſay on the contrary <hi>one Perſon and three Eſſences;</hi> we mean the ſame thing it may be. We expreſs our ſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed differently, but after all we ſhall agree at the bottom; 'twill always be <hi>three ſomewhats</hi> in <hi>one I know not what,</hi> for that's all that the Terms [<hi>Eſſence</hi> and <hi>Perſons</hi>] ſignify in the Mouths of <hi>Tripi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians.</hi> But Raillery apart, who would nor pity St, <hi>Jerom,</hi> who takes ſo much pains <hi>(Epiſt. ad Damaſum)</hi> to enquire whether he ſhould ſay <hi>one Hypoſtaſis</hi> or <hi>three Hypoſtaſes?</hi> What! Learned Doctor, muſt the Pope be conſulted about that? Say what you pleaſe, for you may with a very ſafe Conſcience. Sr. <hi>Auſtin</hi> much better underſtood the ſenſe of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as to the Word Perſon (<hi>de Trinit. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 9.) <q>When, ſays he, 'tis asked what the Three are, human Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnage is ſcanty, and affords not Terms to expreſs it; 'tis therefore anſwer'd <hi>three Perſons,</hi> not as if that was ſome, what to the purpoſe, but ſomething muſt be ſaid, and one muſt not be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent [to the Queſtion.]</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for Terms which expreſs things that fall under our Senſes or Actions, whereof we have a diſtinct and perfect Idea, it falls out quite otherwiſe; they may change or vary, and the things we make them to ſignify may not vary at all in our Minds, or ſuffer the leaſt Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Facts, for inſtance, mention'd in the Apoſtles Creed, are things of that nature, the Ideas whereof are preſerv'd without any Change. As its Articles are plain, few in Number, without any Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, and contain only the Primitive Doctrines of Chriſtianity; it was eaſy therefore to preſerve the ſenſe, and to have always a true Knowledg of them: 'Tis a Faith, as I may ſay, that's born with us, that offers it ſelf to our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings from the Moment we enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, that is, in the Mouth and Heart or every Chriſtian; and there is no need of aſcending into Heaven, of conſulting Councils, nor of deſcending into the Deeps to know it, and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miſſions of Dragoons to impoſe the Lelief of it. Wherefore <hi>Cyril</hi> in <hi>Catech.</hi> 5. <hi>Ruffinus in Expoſ. Symbol. Jerom in Epiſt.</hi> 61. <hi>ad P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

The Paſſage of St. <hi>Hilary</hi> is the more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, becauſe he makes an expreſs Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition between <hi>this</hi> Faith graven upon the <hi>Heart,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> which is only in the <hi>Letter</hi> and the <hi>Writings of Men:</hi> For he congratulates the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Biſhops, for their maintaining the Apoſtolic Faith, for the Spirit wherewith they were ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, and that they knew not the Forms of Faith which were written by Mens Hands. The Spirit here does not ſignify the Holy Ghoſt, as Monſ. <hi>Du Pin</hi> ſuppoſes, but the <hi>Spiritual Senſe</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the <hi>Literal.</hi> Which ſhews, that there was no need of writing down the Apoſtles Creed, in the firſt Ages of the Church. Every one had the ſenſe of it in his Mind: As it was ſhort and plain, and conſiſting only of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Facts and Primitive Truths, which conſtitute the very Eſſence and Spirit of the Chriſtian Religion; it was eaſy for the moſt illiterate to keep it in mind, as to the Subſtance of it; for the reſt every one expreſſed himſelf as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Hence it was, that 'twas very late before any Formula was drawn up, and that too with ſome difference in the Terms and Number of Articles, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly

                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, it muſt not be ſuppoſed, that when ſome particular Chriſtians came at length to enlarge the Apoſtles Creed, by their <hi>Platonic</hi> Speculations, the People entered into thoſe Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Philoſophical Ideas. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways kept themſelves to that Simplicity of Faith, which the general Spirit of Religion had imprinted upon their Minds. "The Chriſtian Religion, ſays Monſ. <hi>Le Vaſſor</hi> (<hi>Traite de l'Examen, ch.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 69.) <q>was at no great diſtance from its firſt and primitive Simplicity till the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> If <hi>Origen</hi> and ſome others before that attempted to adjuſt it to the Principles of Pagan Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, their novel Speculations were not generally received.</q> In ſhort, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen</hi> ſhews us, that nothing but the <hi>Word revealed</hi> was preached to the People, that is to ſay, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt crucified;</hi> but the <hi>Word-God glorified</hi> was reſerved for Perſons of the higher Claſs, that is for Favourite Souls, who had ſpiritualized themſelves in <hi>Plato</hi>'s School.

The Speculations had not yet reached the People, they continued in the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity—For the reſt, it was for the Speculative Divines, and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers bred in <hi>Plato</hi>'s School; ſuch as the <hi>Juſtin Martyrs,</hi> the <hi>Tatians,</hi> and the <hi>Athanagoras</hi>'s were, and other Platonizing Doctors of that ſort.</q> Then <hi>Jurieu</hi> concludes, ſaying, <q>There's no body but knows that Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Explications are not matters of Faith.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true, we muſt do this Juſtice to <hi>Jurieu,</hi> as to own, that he made room for the Myſtery of <hi>God in three Perſons,</hi> in this Simplicity of [the Primitive] Faith. But it would really be a wrong done to his Judgment and good Senſe, to believe that he ſpoke it ſeriouſly. For in ſhort, if he would not affirm, that the Belief <hi>of three Perſons which are but one God,</hi> was one <hi>of thoſe Platonizing Speculations,</hi> againſt which he ſo much declaims; at leaſt he ought to own, that 'tis an <hi>Explication</hi> that has nothing of <hi>Simplicity</hi> in it, and which by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence cannot be a matter of Faith. I deſire him to remember a Remark he has made in his ſeventh Paſtoral Letter. <q>That when Learning was ſcarce among Chriſtians, two or three Learned Men drew the People into their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</q> He could have informed us bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that two or three Platonizing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for they were the Learned Men of the Age, were able to miſlead the People from the Simplicity of their Faith to the Theology of <hi>Plato.</hi> If it be true that <hi>the People</hi> knew this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Theology, Monſ. <hi>Jurieu</hi> has ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more truly than he thought: For we find at the bottom of the Letter, that two Learned <hi>Platoniſts, Origen,</hi> who had his Admirers in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> who had his in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> have not only led the People into their Opinions, but likewiſe all the Learned Men that came after them, who have only copied
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:200403:45"/>from them. And conſequently this The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology, whether it be to be found only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Learned, or with the People too, was none other than a <hi>ſtrange Faith,</hi> which the Learned brought into the Church, and after drew the People into it. It amounts to the ſame thing, either the People underſtood it not, or if they did, 'twas by ſurprize that the Learned impos'd their Myſteries, and made the common People receive a Pagan Notion for the Doctrine of J. C.</p>

                  <p>HAving given ſome account of the way of <hi>Allegories</hi> us'd by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I muſt not forget to ſay ſomething alſo of their Divine <hi>Oeconomy,</hi> which is inſeparable from it. And I muſt ſay of them, that they made uſe of a pious Fraud, to repreſent the Goſpel under nobler Ideas, and in a ſenſe elevated to the reliſh of the Philoſophers, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things to all, that they might win them to Jeſus Chriſt: and this is that which is called their <hi>Oeconomy.</hi> I do not ſay that all the Fathers, particularly the latter, were in the ſecret of this ſort of Conduct. Some of them have ſuffered themſelves to be ſurprized with the very literal ſenſe; and at laſt this Myſtery, which was at firſt prudentially deſigned, degenerated into real Opinions and Metaphyſical Squabbles. It's enough then that I obſerve, that this at firſt was the thing they chiefly aimed at, who brought into the Church this way of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophizing. Hence came that famous <hi>Managery of Myſtery,</hi> ſo much talked of by the Antients, and about which the Moderns at this time diſpute, tho 'tis much alter'd indeed, but it flows howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from the ſame Spring. 'Tis known that the Pagans made uſe of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, to keep up the Credit of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that was filled with ridiculous Storys, ſcandalous and injurious to their Gods. They had ſo much addreſs, as to pretend, that a mythological and myſtical ſenſe was hidden under the um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage of thoſe Symbols.

                  <p>The ſame may be ſaid of the <hi>Jews,</hi> their Law becoming publick by the Verſion of the LXX. They were out of Countenance, that a Law given 'cm from Heaven, ſhould amuſe them with child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and mean Ceremonies, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to defend it from the Scoffs of the Profane, by turning all into Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and extracting ſublime Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to render it the more venerable. <hi>Philo</hi> among others has excelled in this way. The Chriſtians very much follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Practice of the <hi>Jews,</hi> particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who learn'd this Cuſtom of the <hi>Therapeutes.</hi> As the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> were addicted to their Traditions, the <hi>Eſſenes</hi> on the contrary were addic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>way of Allegory,</hi> being fond of extracting from the Scriptures, <hi>quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet ex quolibet.

                  <p>The Obſcurity of our Saviour's Birth, and the Scandal of his Death mightily perplexed the <hi>Catechiſts;</hi> they could not conceal his Death from their Scholars, as
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:200403:46"/>was wont to be done from thoſe who were initiated in the Myſteries of <hi>Ceres.</hi> Wherefore they bethought themſelves of another <hi>Oeconomy,</hi> which would leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen their diſcredit, or balance it with the Honour of a <hi>pretended Pre exiſtence,</hi> by ſuppoſing in Jeſus Chriſt another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which was immortal: and this they repreſented very much like <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Logos,</hi> pretending to diſcover an exact confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity between the Doctrine of St. <hi>John,</hi> and that of the Philoſopher. This <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentum ad hominem</hi> look'd incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably more convincing to their Novices, than that which they drew from Chriſt's Exaltation, which ſeem'd ſomewhat dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, in giving countenance to the <hi>Apotheoſis</hi> of their falſe Gods. Hence is it that they rarely make uſe of the latter, and almoſt always of the former.</p>
                  <p>Was it not, I pray, by this Occonomy that <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Clemens</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> maintain'd, that vertuous Pagans were in a manner Chriſtians, becauſe they partly underſtood Reaſon, or the <hi>Logos?</hi> And by theſe evident Conformitys with 'em, they flatter'd the Pagans, and inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated themſelves very dextrouſly into their good opinion. <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> amaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with great dexterity every thing that was proper in Apologue, to colour and to juſtify the Myſtery of the <hi>Nativity</hi> and the <hi>Birth of Chriſt</hi> (<hi>Apol.</hi> 2.) and takes as much pains to defend the Names and Titles that Chriſtians have given him. <q>Since the Son of God, ſays he to them, would be but a Man like other Men; he was worthy hevertheleſs of being ſtil'd <hi>the Son of God,</hi> ſince all Writers give to God the Character of being <hi>the Father of Men and Gods.</hi> If we ſay further, that beſides his Birth uſually mention'd, this Perion was begotten by God; as his Word (of <hi>Logos</hi>) herein we ſhould do no more than you have already done, who call <hi>Mercury,</hi> the Word, the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the Interpreter of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>With the ſame deſign <hi>Tertullian</hi> (<hi>Apol. c.</hi> 21.) makes a Parallel of the Hiſtory of the Son of God, with the Story of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>'s Children. Receive this Apologue, ſays he to the Pagans (for) it reſembles yours. This he ſpoke in <hi>the way of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy</hi> or <hi>Accommodation.</hi> And it was not only uſual with theſe Fathers thus to accommodate themſelves to the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of the Pagans, but by the ſame method to anſwer their Objections: For when they objected, that the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Chriſt, a Man, was no leſs Idolatry than that whereof the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans accus'd them; 'twas for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the latter to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to <hi>their Oeconomy,</hi> and to find out the ſecond God of <hi>Plato</hi> in that Divine, Power which dwelt in Jeſus Chriſt, which might be worſhip'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Idolatry, it having made Heaven and Earth. To conclude, 'tis this <hi>Occonomy</hi> that gives Rules to the uſe of their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Allegory, and that ſuted it to Occaſions and Circumſtances. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this matter, it muſt be noted, that there are two ſorts of <hi>Allegory:</hi> One, wherein the popular and familiar Ideas are uſed, to accommodate things to the capacity of the Vulgar; which is called <hi>Parable,</hi> or Mythology, and has been us'd by the moral Philoſophers. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, followed by Divines and ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Philoſophers, who affected <hi>myſterious and profound Senſes,</hi> and did accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date themſelves to ſuch as lov'd what we call the <hi>Wonderful.</hi> Of this ſort are thoſe nice Allegories of the Fathers, wherein under great and ſublime Images they cover'd the Simplicity or Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Goſpel. But above all, they endeavour'd to aggrandize the <hi>Perſon</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> wherein one ſees nothing but <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> and <hi>Water.</hi> One muſt conſider the turn they give thoſe things, when they ſpeak as magnificently of 'em as they can, and when they would in a manner make that which ſeems contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with the Philoſophers, appear, by this artful d ſguiſe, to be the very Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of thoſe Philoſophers. But, as it is of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:200403:46"/>the nature of Parable, to make uſe of vulgar and popular Images to adapt to the Capacities of the meaner ſort their great and more ſublime Myſteries, Jeſus Chriſt made uſe of theſe in preaching his Goſpel to the Poor, and in letting down his Doctrine to meaner Capacities. But the Fathers, who had other Occaſions, and were in other circumſtances, took quite another way, and follow'd the Rules of their <hi>Oeconomy;</hi> they advanc'd their Allegorys by the moſt noble and moſt magnificent Images, to aggrandize the Simplicity of the Goſpel, and to make it acceptable, at any rate, to the great Men of the World, to the Learned, and the Philoſophers, with whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd.</p>
                  <p>'Tis this miſchievous Policy that has brought ſo much confuſion into the Chriſtian Religion, that there can be no appealing to pretended Antiquity, the teſtimony whereof is become altogether uſeleſs, and liable to great illuſion. One may think of having recourſe to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, as to very good Witneſſes; but inſtead of that we meet with Oracles ambiguous and unintelligible.</p>
                  <p>A Perſon of good Abilitys in the laſt Age complains of this, as well as I. (<hi>Michael le Vaſſor Traite de l' Examen, ch.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 10.) <q>Since Philoſophy, ſays he, was brought into Chriſtianity, the latter has ſo viſibly degenerated from its primitive. Simplicity, that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> themſelves have taken notice of it. The Men of thought believ'd it would be a great Service done to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to render it agreeable to the taſte of the Philoſophers; they had a mind to reconcile our Myſteries with <hi>Plato</hi>'s Principles, which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely in faſhion, when the Goſpel firſt went abroad into the World. <hi>Origen,</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> afterwards, have ſo embaraſs'd Theology, the former in the Eaſt, and the latter in the Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern Churches, where both had their Admirers and Diſciples, by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to adjuſt Chriſtianity to that Philoſophy; that 'twill coſt one a world of pains to diſtinguiſh <hi>that,</hi> which they and their Followers have ſaid, with any exactneſs of thought, upon divers important points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. They give us none but alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical Senſes to divers Paſſages in the Holy Scriptures. Their Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions appear ſo wide from the Senſe of the Sacred Authors, that one knows not how to underſtand it, ſo as to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the true Doctrine of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles from the particular Speculations of the major part of thoſe (Fathers) to whom we are refer'd, as to faithful Witneſſes of the Faith of the Times they liv'd in.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Fathers were not content to accommodate their Doctrines to the <hi>Platonick Word</hi> (or <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>) but enquir'd further, after another Pre-exiſtence of Jeſus Chriſt, for the ſatisfaction of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and they found it in the <hi>Angel</hi> that ſpoke to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the other <hi>Patriarchs. Tertullian,</hi> in his Diſpute againſt <hi>Marcion, lib.</hi> 3. ſpeaking of the <hi>State</hi> of Chriſt before the Revelation of the Goſpel, ſays, that <hi>he was in that allegorical State of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Grace,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe few Words ſeem to diſcover the whole Myſtery of the Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy of the <hi>Antients:</hi> For they ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, that Chriſt was not only repreſented in the Figures of the Law, but, as <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> ſpeaks, that <hi>he was ſubſtantially pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets,</hi> Tract. 26. in <hi>Mat.</hi> meaning thereby that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets were, if one may ſo ſpeak, ſubſtantial and perſonal Types of Chriſt to come; or rather that Chriſt was then preſent in the Perſon of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, who were his Types. On the like ground may we not ſay, that he was allegorically preſent in all the Angels, who ſpoke from God to Men, and that he was alſo allegorically preſent in that Word of God which created the World? that <hi>powerful Word,</hi> which ſaid, <hi>Let there be Light,</hi> being a Type of this <hi>powerful Word,</hi> which ſaid by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Let the Light ſhine in the Hearts of Men.</hi>

                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:200403:47"/>
                  <p>This allegorical Pre-exiſtence of Chriſt is very agreeable with the Scriptures, which ſay that of him which cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to any thing but theſe Types; as, the <hi>Reproach of Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt propheſying, tempted of Chriſt,</hi> and other Expreſſions of that kind, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to us Jeſus Chriſt in his <hi>allegorical State:</hi> Thoſe particular Commiſſions of Angels and Prophets, being in ſome ſort the <hi>Preludia</hi> of this univerſal and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Commiſſion of Jeſus Chriſt with regard to the whole World. I ought not to paſs over the Remark of Father <hi>Simon</hi> upon this Occonomy of the Antients (<hi>Hiſt. Crit. du N. T. Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 2.) <q>The mingling, ſays he, of the <hi>Platonick Philoſophy</hi> with the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> was not intended to ruin the Orthodox Faith, but the more eaſily to perſuade the <hi>Greeks</hi> to embrace the Chriſtian Religion. The Fathers were in this for imitating the Apoſtles, eſpecially St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſometimes did ſtoop to the Infirmitys of the Weak, <hi>becoming all things to all men.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Father <hi>Simon</hi> obſerves further, that <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> does ſometimes carry this Occonomy too far; that he applies himſelf intirely to Allegory, it being faſhionable in his time amongſt the Chriſtians, eſpecially with the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> who thought thereby to raiſe the Credit of the Scriptures; that he is no ways behind 'em in point of Invention and Subtilty: That this was the more excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable in him, becauſe he liv'd in a great City, where 'tis likely they affected thoſe kind of Subtilties; and that he believ'd 'em of uſe to eſtabliſh the Chriſtian Religion, it being a prudent part in an able Maſter to adapt things to the capacity of them he is to inſtruct: That his <hi>Paedagogus,</hi> wherein he was to lay down nothing but plain Inſtructions, was drawn up with this deſign; and that in it he explains the Scriptures in the ſublime and allegorical Senſe. He obſerves alſo, Chap. 4. <q>That thoſe who had not theſe ſublime Notions, paſs'd for plain weak Chriſtians, who knew not the deſign of Religion; that the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> imagin'd themſelves outdid all others in this kind of Knowledg, and that it had been better if the Orthodox had not imitated them therein, but had contented themſelves with the literal Expoſitions of the Scriptures. He goes forward to ſay, that the <hi>Jews</hi> had mingled in their Religion divers <hi>Platonick Notions,</hi> whereof one finds at this day not a few in their <hi>Cabaliſtick Writings.</hi> This made ſome impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the Minds of ſome of the firſt Chriſtians, who read with pleaſure Books that treated of Angels, and their Converſe with Men.</q> The ſame Author makes it appear, <q>That not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe who rejected the <hi>allegorical way,</hi> were accounted illiterate, but even paſs'd for Hereticks too (<hi>ibid. chap.</hi> 31.) and that <hi>Theodorus</hi> of <hi>Mop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues,</hi> who followed the literal Senſe of the Bible, according to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of his Maſter <hi>Diodorus,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided the ſpiritual and allegorical Senſe, was reckoned for a Perſon who favour'd <hi>Judaiſm</hi> by his too <hi>lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Expoſitions.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For my part, I make no doubt, but 'twas of that Set of Divines who imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated <hi>Theodorus,</hi> that <hi>Pamphilus</hi> is ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when he complains <hi>(Apol. pro Orig.)</hi> 
                     <q>That they who charg'd <hi>Origen</hi> with ſo many Abſurdities, would not admit Allegory to be us'd in expounding the Holy Scriptures.</q> It may be conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd from theſe words, that the great reaſon why the <hi>Ebionites</hi> and <hi>Nazarenes</hi> were accounted plain ſimple People, and poor in the Faith, was this, that they rejected the allegorical Theology of the <hi>Platonizing</hi> and <hi>Gnoſtick</hi> Chriſtians: The Word <hi>[Ebionite]</hi> which ſignifies poor, and the other Word <hi>[Gnoſtick]</hi> which ſignifies knowing, being directly oppos'd. 'Tis certain <hi>Origen</hi> calls the <hi>Ebionites</hi> poor in Spirit, <hi>Philoc. c.</hi> 1. becauſe they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her'd too much to the Poverty of the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:200403:47"/>Letter, or literal Senſe, and deſpis'd the rich and the ſublime Senſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation. 'Tis moreover upon the ſame account, that ſo many great Men are ſaid to <hi>Judaize,</hi> becauſe they were for keeping the Scriptures in their natural and literal Senſe; ſuch were <hi>Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion,</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>'Tis evident that the Fathers, who were for appearing Learned, and would not be outdone by the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> have allegoriz'd after the very manner of thoſe <hi>Hereticks;</hi> but upon ſuch things that had ſome ſort of Foundation in the Scriptures, and in the Philoſophy of thoſe Times, embrac'd by the <hi>Jews,</hi> or the <hi>Platonick</hi> Party. As for inſtance, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Ideas and <hi>Decrees of God;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> about the <hi>Soul</hi> of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> about the Spirit that form'd, and after ſanctified him; about the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that were the <hi>Preludia</hi> of his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; or laſtly, about that <hi>Word of God,</hi> which created the World, to whom they aſcrib'd Perſonality, after the <hi>Platonick</hi> way. The <hi>Word,</hi> or <hi>Logos,</hi> might ſignify all theſe things, the Wiſdom of God that dwelt in Jeſus Chriſt, his pre-exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Soul, the Spirit that form'd him, and the facility with which he wrought ſo many Miracles, only, as it were, at the expence of a Word. After this manner the <hi>Jews</hi> have allegoriz'd upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven things that they ſay were created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World, among which they count the Name, or the Glory of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> To ſay the truth, the Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Fathers very often varys: For at one time they are for concealing the <hi>ſublimer part</hi> of their Myſteries, that they mayn't give offence to ſome ſturdy Minds, that will not ſo readily give way to myſtical Notions. At other times they paſs over the plainer part of Religion, to gain upon their ſpeculative Gentlemen, who admire chiefly what we call the <hi>Wonderful.</hi> But however, they are always conſtant in purſuing this Deſign of their <hi>Oeconomy</hi> and Rule of Prudence, in adapting themſelves to the <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Reliſh</hi> of every body, in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Myſtery of every thing, to beget in their Scholars a Veneration for their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, when they come to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with 'em. And further, they take care to diſtinguiſh between <hi>thoſe Opinions,</hi> which were tranſmitted to 'em by the Writings of the Apoſtles, and <hi>others</hi> which came from the ſame Apoſtles by Tradition only, and in <hi>Myſtery,</hi> as St. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſpeaks (<hi>Lib. de Spir. S. ad Amphil. Cap.</hi> 27.) that is, by the way of <hi>ſecret Diſcipline and Inſtruction. Clemens</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria</hi> makes mention of theſe laſt Opinions (<hi>Stromat.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 576.) and calls 'em, <hi>The Leſſon of the Perfect,</hi> which conſiſts in certain ſpiritual and ſublime Senſes, which were deliver'd <hi>vivâ voce,</hi> and by Tradition; but the Apoſtles could not ſet 'em down in their Epiſtles.</p>
                  <p>This Expedient of <hi>ſetret Tradition</hi> open'd a wide Field for philoſophizing according to their humour, and is adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the purpoſe of introducing new Opinions into Religion. We muſt be upon our guard when we are reading their Writings, and take very little of them in the literal Senſe, where every thing almoſt is allegorical, and they are throout purſuing what we call the <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful.</hi> 'Tis well known to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, that the <hi>Declamations</hi> and <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe</hi>'s of the Fathers have given birth to ſome Errors, and the Idolatry prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd at this day. They know well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough how to account for the hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Expoſitions of the Antients upon the Euchariſt; as, that Jeſus Chriſt was offer'd upon an Altar; that he was ſlain, ſtrangl'd, extended, died, carry'd, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And theſe ridiculous Apoſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe's: <hi>O great and ſacred Paſſover, the Purgation of our Sins!</hi> &amp;c. (Greg. Naz.) <hi>O Divine and ſacred Myſtery! vouchſaſe to remove the Veil wherewith we are encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed, and manifeſt your ſelf clearly to us, by enlightning with your brightneſs the Eyes of our Mind.</hi> (<hi>See</hi> Counterſeit Denis.) Theſe Apoſtrophe's ſeem to deify the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and to make it a Perſon. Why
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:200403:48"/>ſhould we not acknowledg at the ſame time, that the over-curious <hi>Platoniſm</hi> of the ſame Fathers has led 'em into thoſe extravagant Deſcriptions, whereby they have made a ſecond God, a Perſon of the <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Logos,</hi> a Son begotten before Ages, and incarnate in time? Myſteries no leſs ſtrange than that of <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who does not ſee that they had a mind to ſpeak magnificently of every thing? They aſcrib'd a Divine and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Virtue to the Oil and the Cream: They ſay, that the Holy Ghoſt has chang'd and transform'd 'em by a Divine Emcacy. They have ſaid no leſs of Baptiſm; for they believ'd the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and the Holy Ghoſt deſcending, and inſinuating it ſelf into the Water us'd in that Sacrament, imparts to it the Power and Virtue of regenerating. They allow that the Euchariſt ſhews a Divine and quickening Virtue emanating from the Body of the <hi>incarnate Word.</hi> The <hi>Word,</hi> according to them, is an Emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Subſtance of <hi>God:</hi> The Body of Chriſt is hypoſtatically united to the <hi>Word:</hi> The Bread is hypoſtatically united to that Divine Body, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently hath the quickening Virtue of the Word. They own a twofold Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the Word is the <hi>Emanation</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the quickening Virtue of his Fleſh is an <hi>Emanation</hi> of the Word. And they hold a twofold Incarnation; one of the Word in the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; and another of the quickening Virtue of the Body of Chriſt in the Bread of the Sacrament. This was a Syſtem of Policy well contriv'd, whereby theſe cunning Doctors brought nothing leſs than Divinity into every thing, and ſpoke with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage upon the meaneſt Subjects, to make 'em look myſterious and venerable. It may be ſaid of them, as has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd of thoſe who make Canons in <hi>Councils,</hi> that they ſpake more than they meant; ſo that many Ages after, Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are diſcover'd in their Expreſſions, which they never dreamt of. I have met with nothing ſo like that, as theſe two Apoſtrophe's, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> chants in her Liturgy: One is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd to the Trinity, <hi>O Holy, Bleſſed and Glorious Trinity, Three Perſons and One God, have Mercy upon us miſerable Sinners!</hi> The other is addreſs'd to the Croſs of Chriſt, <hi>O Croſs, my only Hope, I ſalute thee at this time of the Paſſion! in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Righteouſneſs of Good Men, and pardon the Crimes of the Wicked.</hi> Here you have two <hi>Saints,</hi> which one and the ſame Superſtition hath <hi>canoniz'd,</hi> two Prayers caſt in the ſame <hi>Mould;</hi> for both one and t'other are the fruit of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and of <hi>falſe Eloquence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon which I will make this Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it has fal'n out with the Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of theſe Primitive Fathers, as it has with the Admirers of Epiſcopacy here in <hi>England,</hi> who having retain'd a Liturgy and divers Ceremonies, that they might bring over the more Papiſts to their Communion, yet they ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to look upon thoſe things, at this time, in a ſort neceſſary to Religion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho there's now no more occaſion for that Reaſon of Prudence; and even as great a Reaſon of Charity, and a ſecond Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Prudence, ſhould oblige 'em to relax, or lay 'em by, to gain the Non-Conformiſts. 'Tis the ſame caſe with the Allegorical and Oeconomical Myſtery of the antient Fathers: The <hi>Reaſon of Prudence</hi> ceaſing, ſince we have now no more <hi>Platoniſts</hi> to gain, nor <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> to outbrave, the Oeconomy of the <hi>Logos</hi> ought to ceaſe at the ſame time. Yet we do in this, as in every thing elſe, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reform; and it often happens that the Religion of Poſterity is nothing elſe but the mere Policy or Oeconomy of their Anceſtors.</p>
                  <p>I have but one Reflection more to ſhew the Source of this <hi>Allegory. Cerinthus</hi> was the Man who firſt brought in this uſage of <hi>Platonizing:</hi> As he is the firſt Author of a <hi>Logos,</hi> or an <hi>inviſible Chriſt,</hi> he is alſo the firſt who began to make uſe of the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> in the Chriſtian Religion.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:200403:48"/>'Tis he who turns the Reſurrection into <hi>Allegory,</hi> explaining it by the Evangelical Regeneration, or rather by the State of <hi>Quietude,</hi> wherein the Contemplative are, when they quit this World to raiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the <hi>Speculation of Myſteries,</hi> and the Knowledg of <hi>Ideas.</hi> The <hi>Quietiſts</hi> have not fail'd to frame an Ideal and <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical Word</hi> or <hi>Logos,</hi> even as they have alſo taught an <hi>Allegorical</hi> and <hi>Ideal Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi> Without queſtion they allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riz'd, when they ſaid, <hi>Chriſt</hi> deſcended into <hi>Jeſus,</hi> meaning, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, and made the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when the Holy Ghoſt deſcended upon him at his Baptiſm. (See <hi>Grotius</hi> on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1.) They did no leſs allegorize, when upon the ſame ground they added, that the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which deſcended on <hi>Jeſus,</hi> aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Heaven, and left him at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Paſſion. By which they meant, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> humbl'd himſelf, that he laid by the Power and the Spirit with which he was endu'd, and left himſelf to be crucified, as a Man feeble, and without Power, or rather as a Slave (<hi>Tertul. contra Prax. cap.</hi> 30.) St. <hi>Hilary</hi> and St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> did not underſtand ſo much fineneſs, ſince they made bold to ſay bluntly, and without figure, <hi>that the Word was divorc'd from the Fleſh,</hi> that <hi>the God was ſeparated from the Man, and left him to himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſhort, that which I am ſaying of the uſe of this Allegory, amounts to this: 'Tis well known, that the Pagans invented three ſorts of <hi>Allegory,</hi> the Phyſical, the Moral, and the Theological; which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail'd 'em at a pinch, to cover the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of their Fables, and of the Hiſtory of their Gods. 'Tis after this way they defended themſelves, as we ſee in St. <hi>Clemens</hi> his Recognitions, <hi>lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 30. ſaying, that the literal Senſe of their Fables was contriv'd in condeſcenſion to the Vulgar; but that they had beſides an allegorical and elevated Senſe for the Learned. That in this laſt Senſe they ſaid, for example, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> from his own Brain begat the Goddeſs <hi>Minerva,</hi> that is, Wiſdom; to ſhew, that 'tis by his Wiſdom that the Father of all things created the World. One may truly ſay, the Chriſtians have in a manner follow'd the ſame Method: For not to mention their many Moral Allegories, which they invented to conceal that which ſeemed to 'em too low and mean for the Majeſty of the H. Scriptures, 'tis ſufficient to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve here, that all they have told us of <hi>an eternal and inviſible Son,</hi> of his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible Generation, and other Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the like nature, is nothing elſe but a <hi>theological Allegory,</hi> by which they varniſh'd whatever appear'd too mean in the eyes of Philoſophers, in the Hiſtory of Jeſus Chriſt. The <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have hereby equally quitted themſelves of a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, that expos'd 'em to mutual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches. The <hi>Pagans</hi> were aſham'd of their ridiculous <hi>Fables,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were of the <hi>Croſs of Chriſt;</hi> and both of 'em ſurmounted thoſe Inconveniences by a dextrous uſe of (what we call) the <hi>Wonderful,</hi> which is to be met with in their <hi>Allegory.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> An Account of what the Fathers called <hi>Theology.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WHAT the Fathers called <hi>Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> is another ſort of <hi>Machine</hi> they acted withal to repreſent to us a contemplative Goſpel, formed after the Ideas of <hi>Plato,</hi> which <hi>theologizes,</hi> that is, <hi>ſpeaks of any Perſon in the ſame Stile, as one uſually ſpeaks of God:</hi> as if the Perſon had a miraculous Birth, to ſay he <hi>came down from Heaven;</hi> if he reform'd Mankind, to ſay <hi>he created the World;</hi> if God rais'd him to any extraordinary Dignity, to ſay that <hi>he was begotten of God.</hi> All this ſo far agrees with the Scriptures, but eſpecially with the Stile of St. <hi>John,</hi> who affects throughout his Writings to <hi>theologize</hi> all the Subjects he treats on. I will give you but this one Inſtance, <hi>John</hi> 3.13. <hi>No Man,</hi> ſays he, <hi>has aſcended into Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. The fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Words do ſhew that he <hi>theologized</hi> in this Paſſage: he had ſaid to the <hi>Jews, How will you believe, if I tell you of Heavenly things? For no Man has aſcended into Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. that is, to ſay plainly, that no Man can acquaint you with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Things, but he who came down from Heaven, or who drew his Origin from Heaven. The ſenſe therefore is this, <hi>The Son of Man who was born from Heaven by the Holy Ghoſt</hi> (and on this account may be ſaid, in the theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal way, <hi>to have come down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>) <hi>The ſame Son of Man was raiſed to the Knowledg of all the Secrets of Heaven, by the Gifts he received from the ſame Spirit;</hi> and on that account it may be further ſaid in the theological Stile, <hi>That be aſcended into Heaven.</hi> No Man then was rais'd to the Knowledg of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of Heaven, but he who was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally from Heaven, that is, the Son of Man who was wholly from Heaven. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner the <hi>Jews</hi> did <hi>theologize,</hi> when they ſaid, that their Law was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Creation of the <hi>World.</hi> The <hi>Mahometans</hi> do the ſame, when they ſpeak ſo magnificently of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as to ſay <hi>it fell down from Heaven;</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſpeaking the ſame thing of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which they call the Word of God, which was not made, but came down from Heaven. <hi>Barthol. Edeſſen. Confut. Agar.</hi> They give alſo the ſame Honour to Jeſus Chriſt, who becauſe he was born without a human Father, after an extraordinary manner, is, in their oriental and theological Stile, the <hi>Eternal</hi> Word, the <hi>Word</hi> of God by way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence: that is, he is the Word, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had no other Father, than that Word and that Commandment had, which made the World from nothing. 2. Becauſe he with the aſſiſtance of that very Word, has diſtinguiſh'd himſelf by a great number of Miracles. <hi>Hortinger Hiſt.

                  <p>Again, nothing is more reaſonable, than that manner of <hi>Theologizing</hi> things great and extraordinary, provided all theſe pompous Expreſſions be taken in a metaphorical ſenſe. But the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is, that the <hi>groſſer Platoniſm</hi> has impos'd upon the Fathers, who have ſpoken in this manner of J.C. in the very Letter: So that to <hi>theologize</hi> with them, is to aſcribe to Jeſus Chriſt the <hi>Divine Nature and Subſtance</hi> with all its Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, or at leaſt to aſcribe to him a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture very near and like to that of God; for ſo <hi>Euſebius, arianizing upon the Nature of the pre-exiſtent Word,</hi> calls him, <hi>Hiſt.

The current Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of the Scriptures ſays nothing of this: 'tis no matter for that, ſome know how to feign and ſuppoſe a myſtic Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, which does. But 'twas not an eaſy thing to make a <hi>God begotten before Ages,</hi> of a Man born at <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> There's ſomething that anſwers all difficulties, and that's another Expedient they have thought on, which is, to diſtinguiſh the two Natures in Jeſus Chriſt, the Divine Nature which they call <hi>Theology,</hi> and the Human which they call <hi>Oeconomy;</hi> and to frame hereupon a new Word which ſignifies nothing, becauſe it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the Mind at the ſame time two I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas that deſtroy each other, <hi>viz. Man-God,</hi> or a <hi>God-Man.</hi> They have left to <hi>the Man</hi> the Hiſtory and Facts of the Goſpel, but for <hi>the God</hi> they have found out a nobler Goſpel in the World of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas.</p>
                  <p>'Tis ſomewhat entertaining to obſerve what the Author of the <hi>2d Homil. in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſos</hi> aſcribed to <hi>Origen,</hi> ſays to this purpoſe: Having compar'd St. <hi>John</hi> to a <hi>Spiritual Eagle,</hi> who ſoars with a ſwift Flight into the ſublimeſt Regions of Theology, and the greateſt heights of Contemplation; he afterwards draws a Parallel between him and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and diſtinguiſhes between <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Science;</hi> between <hi>Practice,</hi> which is common to all Chriſtians, and <hi>Contemplation,</hi> which is a <hi>Goſpel</hi> for <hi>Seraphic</hi> Souls. He makes St. <hi>Peter</hi> the Type of <hi>Faith and Practice</hi> in his good Confeſſion, <hi>Thou art the Chriſt the Son of the living God.</hi> But he makes St. <hi>John</hi> to be as it were the Model of <hi>Science</hi> and <hi>Contemplation,</hi> with reſpect to the admirable <hi>Exordium</hi> of his Goſpel; <hi>In the beginning was the Word,</hi> &amp;c. <q>St. <hi>John,</hi> ſays he, reſting himſelf alone upon the Boſom of Chriſt, this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege or Favour was to him the Sign and Sacrament, or Seal, of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.</hi> This <hi>John,</hi> ſays he, who was not a mere Man, but more than a Man, ſince by the Penetration of his Mind and his Wiſdom, he enter'd into the Secrets of <hi>one Eſſence and three Subſtances,</hi> or <hi>of three Subſtances in one Eſſence.</hi> This <hi>John</hi> who deified himſelf, could not by his Penetration reach God himſelf, till he had firſt made himſelf a God.</q> This is very loftily ſpoke, the Fathers were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to make a God of the <hi>Word;</hi> they went farther, and make a God of St. <hi>John</hi> too, becauſe he ſpoke ſo divinely. 'Twas a Tranſport of their Zeal and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the <hi>Word,</hi> when they deified the Apoſtle, who had before in their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion ſo well deified the <hi>Word.</hi> This Zeal of theirs extends it ſelf even to the <hi>Divine Plato,</hi> to whom they thought themſelves no leſs obliged; for they have done him the Honour to ſay, that when Jeſus Chriſt deſcended into Hell, <hi>Plato</hi> was the firſt who came before the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> of whom he had ſpoken with that Magnificence in his Writings.</p>
                  <p>By virtue of the ſame true <hi>Platonic</hi> Zeal, <hi>Euſebius de Vita Conſtant. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 55. calls <hi>Conſtantine</hi> an Eagle, and honours him with the ſame Elogy that was given St. <hi>John;</hi> for how great muſt the Obligation be to this new Apoſtle, for diſcovering the profound Myſtery of <hi>Conſubſtantiality,</hi> for which the Church was indebted to him? 'Tis for the ſame reaſon that he has the Character beſtow'd upon him, of being a <hi>profound Divine,</hi> an <hi>Expounder of Myſteries, the Bird of Paradiſe,</hi> &amp;c. by the <hi>counterfeit Dionyſius,</hi> who has found Books ſtuffed with the moſt refined <hi>Platoniſm.</hi> He who knew ſo much of the Secrets of the Celeſtial Court, and has told us ſuch News of the Hierarchy of the Angels, might as well inſtruct us in the Nature, the Number, and the Order of the <hi>Divine Perſons.</hi>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:200403:50"/>Theſe myſtical Eagles know how, when they pleaſe, to ſoar beyond the bounds of Revelation, and to penetrate into the profound Secrets of the <hi>Deity,</hi> I would ſay of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in Trinity</hi> and <hi>the Trinity in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi> And what Praſſes are due to them for ſuch fine Diſcoveries? Certainly the Author I am ſpeaking of deſerves himſelf the Character of an Eagle; for obſerve how far he advances his Philoſophy. He will have the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures' to be an intelligible World, made up of four Elements. The Hiſtorical Part he calls the Earth, the Moral Part the Water: that Part which is the object of natural Science is the Air: and laſtly that which is the Object of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Contemplation is the fourth Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Fire. And 'tis this Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſays he, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> call The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology: Whence he takes occaſion to call St. <hi>John</hi> a <hi>great Theologue</hi> or Divine; <q>Becauſe, ſays he, he raiſes himſelf far above the Hiſtorical, the Moral, and the natural Objects.</q> Thus <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius the Areopagite,</hi> ſpeaking of the ſame Goſpel of St. <hi>John,</hi> calls <hi>it ſupernatural and tranſcendental Theology.</hi> In ſhort, Monſ. <hi>Daille, de Libris ſuppoſ. Dionyſ.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>c.</hi> 16. tells you, <hi>That one finds in the three other Goſpels, nothing but the Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy of Jeſus Chriſt; but one ſees in the Goſpel of St.</hi> John <hi>the Theology of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it appears, that the Antients did not call by the Name of <hi>Theology,</hi> that Science which treats of God in a plain obvious manner; but ſuch <hi>refined contemplative Diſcourſes,</hi> which ſpeak of him in the <hi>abſtract way:</hi> ſo that their Theology was in a manner the ſame with what we call Metaphyſicks, that is, the Philoſophy of curious abſtracted Minds. How great an Abuſe of the Word was this! As if <hi>true Theology</hi> was not that, which had for its Object a ſenſible Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a plain Goſpel ſuted to the Capacities of the common People, which theſe Gontlemen are pleas'd to call a Goſpel that is groſs and corporeal. How! The Chimeras and the crude Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of the Mind of Man ſhall be compared to the moſt noble Elements, and the firſt Facts of the Goſpel with the Precepts of a good Life; that is, <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and the <hi>Moral</hi> (upon which, as upon two firm Pillars, are founded our Faith and Practice) ſhall in their account be no more than the terreſtrial and groſſer Element. Is not that to reduce the <hi>Science</hi> of the <hi>Perſect</hi> to carnal Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? I might as well like <hi>Homer</hi>'s The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology, who at the ſame time as he deifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, debas'd the Gods. Agreeable to the Model of this noble Theology, <hi>Euſebius Demonſt. Evang. lib.</hi> 4. and <hi>Origen Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>in Joan.</hi> have fancied a certain Son of God, whom they call <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, The theological Son, or the Son who is theologized, that is without doubt, a Son in Idea, the Object of their profound Speculations. For to <hi>theologize,</hi> according to them, is not only to ſpeak of <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Attributes,</hi> but of <hi>Angels</hi> too, of <hi>Aeons,</hi> of <hi>Ideas,</hi> of <hi>Emanations;</hi> and in a word, of every thing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the <hi>intelligible World</hi> of the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſts;</hi> Theology being a Term affected by all the <hi>contemplative Gentlemen,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Orthodox</hi> or <hi>Gnoſticks.</hi> Theſe ſort of Folks did not regard the Facts of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which prove its Divine Authority, any otherwiſe than as groſſer Proofs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for vulgar weaker Minds. But for <hi>Contemplation,</hi> the Caſe was quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; this they thought a noble and powerful Medium, by which Souls of the firſt Rank elevated themſelves to the Knowledg of <hi>the nobleſt Truths.</hi> Yet the Goſpel is not founded upon any thing but <hi>Facts,</hi> and the chief Objects of our Faith are certain Facts contained in the Apoſtles Creed. Is it not therefore a putting the Goſpel upon another Foot, if we carry on our Contemplations to Abſtractions, and the Ideas of a crude chimerical Metaphyſicks? 'Tis an extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Syſtem, if inſtead of Facts well proved and rightly circumſtanced, there be nothing left but a mere Operation of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:200403:50"/>the Underſtanding, and an <hi>Ens Rationis,</hi> which theſe Gentlemen are pleas'd to call the <hi>Word</hi> or the <hi>Son theologized.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That great Man Monſ. <hi>Jurieu,</hi> whom God was pleaſed to favour with the knowledg of every thing, did not fail to ſet aſide this <hi>falſe Theology</hi> of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> (7 <hi>Ler. Paſt. de la</hi> 3. <hi>Année</hi>) <q>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Faith of the Vulgar, ſays he, which was immediately founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sacred Writings, the Doctors fram'd a <hi>Theology,</hi> that is, they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to expound the Myſteries in a ſenſe beyond that wherein the Holy Scriptures themſelves have delivered them. And 'tis in that they have diſagreed, and one muſt not wonder at it, becauſe the things they went about to explain were profound, and it may be inexplicable; and becauſe they made uſe of a falſe Philoſophy, which they brought into their <hi>Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</hi> And by ſo doing they have rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Theology,</hi> and at laſt Religion in all Ages. The Faith of the Antients therefore muſt not be condemned as if it were changed, altho they diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in their Theology. And it muſt be noted, that this Theology ſhould not be admitted into the <hi>Faith:</hi> that is, <hi>Articles of Faith</hi> ſhould not be formed out of <hi>Theological Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
                     </q> Is not this much for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Theology of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents? According to Monſ. <hi>Jurieu,</hi> theſe good Doctors could not <hi>theologize</hi> the Son, without hazarding the <hi>Faith;</hi> and conſequently, one ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive amongſt the Articles of Faith their theological Explications, concerning <hi>a Son begotten and not made,</hi> an <hi>Internal Word,</hi> and a Word brought forth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nevertheleſs it's well known, that the Fathers conſider'd the theological Senſe not only as true, but as that which the Spirit of God had chiefly in its view. So that they who would impoſe the Faith of the theological Senſe of the <hi>Word,</hi> becauſe the Fathers urg'd it, are themſelves obliged to receive all the other theological Senſes, which the ſame Fathers have given to ſo many other Terms in Scripture, and which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be no leſs the Purport and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Holy Ghoſt, which yet is not done, but they are looked upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as ridiculous. Why therefore is it not acknowledged <hi>bona Fide</hi> alſo, that the Expoſition of the <hi>Logos or Word,</hi> is one of thoſe wretched Allegories ſo much declaimed againſt at that day, and an Article of that <hi>falſe Theology,</hi> which is incompatible with <hi>the Chriſtian Faith?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let us pay as much reſpect to the Fathers as we can, let us preſerve <hi>their Theology;</hi> be it ſo, provided that the theological Senſe be not ſaid to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for any other than <hi>contemplative and ſeraphic Minds,</hi> and that no more than the Faith or Belief of the plain natural ſenſe be requir'd of Men as Men-<hi>Origen</hi> was too fair to deſire more than this, he acquaints his Readers at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Book <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that the Sacred Writers did not concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with abſtruſe Matters and ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Subjects, which few of them, whom they called to the Chriſtian Religion, were capable of underſtanding; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined themſelves to thoſe few clear Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which were neceſſary for the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the World, to bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a State of Righteouſneſs, and give them hopes of Immortality: Leaving the more refined Contemplations, which were not contrary to <hi>prime Truths,</hi> to the commendable Curioſity of thoſe, whom Nature and Education had qualify'd for ſuch Enquiries.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Ruſt</hi> (in his Diſcourſe of <hi>Origen</hi> and the chief of his Opinions) has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved alſo: <q>That there were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Truths, which the Apoſtles had clearly taught, and the Church recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the contrary whereto cannot be received, without retrenching an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential part of Religion. But that there were beſides ſome Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, about which the Scriptures had not determin'd any thing; and that the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:200403:51"/>Truth as to theſe matters was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely concealed by the Holy Ghoſt, as <hi>Origen</hi> thought, to excite their Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Induſtry, who were Lovers of the Truth, that the Diſcovery of ſo great a Treaſure might be a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for their pious Enquiries.</q> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt all the other Fathers agreed in this very Principle with <hi>Origen,</hi> that the contemplative Subjects were not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nor eſſential to Religion, that they did not oblige ordinary Chriſtians, and that they were left to the commendable Enquiries of the <hi>Curious. Servetus,</hi> who conſtantly imitates the Fathers, agrees in this, tho he was in other reſpects a great Admirer of <hi>Platoniſm</hi> and <hi>Contemplation.</hi> 
                     <q>The Apoſtles, ſays he, <hi>de Trinit. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 50. did not raſhly publiſh this great Myſtery of the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the <hi>Word;</hi> 'twas after ſeveral Eſſays, and having faſted and prayed, that St. <hi>John</hi> pronounced theſe Words, <hi>In the beginning was the Word,</hi> &amp;c. 'Twas ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to Salvation to believe, that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was the Chriſt or the Meſſias, the Son of God, the Saviour of the World.</hi> The common People were juſtified by this Faith alone, altho they did not exactly know his Divinity. You therefore, pious Readers, who are not able to comprehend the manner of his <hi>Generation,</hi> nor the whole Fulneſs of his Divinity, always believe that he is the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> begotten of God, and thy Saviour. This is the only thing you ſhould believe, that you may live by him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let us hear <hi>Origen</hi> ſpeak for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; 'tis in his Preface to St. <hi>John,</hi> that one ſhall find the famous diſtinction he makes between the <hi>intelligible</hi> and the <hi>ſenſible Goſpel;</hi> and how he there divides Chriſtians <hi>into two Claſſes,</hi> the one of thoſe who are Children in the Faith, and are led by the <hi>Rudiments</hi> of the Goſpel; and the other of thoſe <hi>intelligent and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated Minds,</hi> who are capable of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>the Divinity of the glorified God:</hi> 
                     <q>That Doctor or Teacher, ſays he, who is willing to profit all Perſons, cannot however make the <hi>ſecret and ſublime Chriſtianity</hi> known to ſuch who can only underſtand the plain and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Chriſtianity. Wherefore 'tis neceſſary that we ſhould be Miniſters of the Goſpel, as well in <hi>the Letter</hi> as in <hi>the Spirit,</hi> and that we preach the <hi>ſenſible</hi> or <hi>corporeal Goſpel</hi> (as he ſtiles it) When we ſee it proper, we tell the <hi>Carnal,</hi> that we aim at nothing elſe, <hi>but to know Jeſus Chriſt crucified.</hi> But when we meet with the <hi>elevated Minds,</hi> that are advanced in the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of our Saviour, and enflamed with the Love of <hi>Heavenly Wiſdom,</hi> 'tis theſe we acquaint with the Knowledg of the Word or <hi>Logos.</hi>
                     </q> And in his 7th Book againſt <hi>Celſus,</hi> 
                     <q>There is not one Perſon, ſays he, to whom Jeſus Chriſt does not give a taſt of theſe Myſteries ſome way or other: For he imparts his Theology to the Wiſe, who raiſe their Minds to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template ſublime Subjects. On the other hand, he accommodates himſelf to the Capacity of the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of Idiots, of the Weak, of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of Slaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He affords them ſuch means of a good Life as they ſeek after, keeping from them ſuch Notions as they cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thanks be to God I can now take Breath: The Doctrine of <hi>God the Word,</hi> is no more than ſecret (or myſtical) Chriſtianity, not neceſſary to the Vulgar, and ſerves only for Contemplation. May it continue to be the Study of <hi>contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Minds,</hi> who were born for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of <hi>knowing Myſteries,</hi> and have Skill to advance their Knowledg <hi>beyond Revelation.</hi> It's enough for me, that I have their Leave to content my ſelf with <hi>plain revealed Chriſtianity,</hi> which is the Object of Faith; and that they allowing me the Rudiments (or Leſſons) of the Goſpel for my Guide, I may ſay, with their Leave, as the Apoſtle and other plain ſimple Chriſtians of the ſame Claſs,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:200403:51"/>
                     <hi>I know nothing but Jeſus Chriſt crucified.</hi> Really one could not but with ſurprize hear ſo great a Doctor as <hi>Origen</hi> treating the Chriſtian Religion, and the Theology of St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo unworthily; if one did not know at the ſame time, his Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Platoniſm. What! ſhall this <hi>Contemplation</hi> be accounted the <hi>ſublime Chriſtianity,</hi> becauſe it has found out Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of it ſelf without the help of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation? What then is that <hi>poor Faith</hi> that's founded upon Objects revealed? Can it be any thing more or leſs than a <hi>carnal Chriſtianity?</hi> 'Tis ſome favour however that it may be <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> Tho ſo much as that will hardly be granted, at this time of Day. They who know nothing but a <hi>crucified Chriſt,</hi> do not paſs even for Chriſtians now; a <hi>deified Jeſus,</hi> is the only Orthodoxy.</p>
                  <p>If you have a mind to obſerve alſo what a prodigious difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Simplicity of the Apoſtolic Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Myſtery of Platoniſm;</hi> you need only to conſider how little regard it had to the firſt: aſſoon as any one own'd this Fundamental Article, that <hi>Jeſus was the Meſſias,</hi> he was inſtantly baptized and received as a true Member of the Church. But when its Articles of Faith were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and became inexplicable by the profound Speculations with which they were clog'd, how cautiouſly and warily did they initiate Perſons in the <hi>Theology</hi> of the ſame Church. This is plain from the ſeveral degrees of the <hi>catechized</hi> State, thro which their Novices paſſed. At firſt they did not ſuffer them to come within their Churches, then they admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 'em only to hear Sermons, after that they might be preſent at the Prayers; at laſt after long Inſtructions they were qualified for Baptiſm: <hi>Tantae molis erat Platonis condere gentem;</hi> So great a Task had they to eſtabliſh the <hi>Platonick</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology! Will it not be ſaid, that theſe are the ſame Formalities that were us'd in admitting the antient <hi>Myſtae?</hi> Thro how many degrees muſt they paſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were admitted to enter the Sanctuary of the <hi>Great Goddeſs?</hi> that is, before they became <hi>Epoprae</hi> or Eye-Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the moſt private Ceremonies. The <hi>Pagans</hi> loſt nothing (in the Forms of Initiation) by embracing the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion.</p>
                  <p>But this is not all, it muſt be farther conſider'd, what a Beadroll of Myſteries are taught in their Catechiſings: Take but that of <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and you will certainly meet with them in him. There you have the <hi>Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Eternal Generation,</hi> the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> the <hi>ſacred and venerable Sacrifice,</hi> and many other things of that nature, that muſt be known, he tells you, in order to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. If any one of them be neglected, there's no Admiſſion for you. All theſe Myſteries have an eſſential Band of Union between them; ſo that if any one of them be not underſtood, you are in peril of being ignorant of all the reſt. And hereupon <hi>Cyril</hi> recommends to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techized,</hi> before all other things, the Knowledg of theſe Myſteries. What a Drudgery is here for the <hi>poor Novices!</hi> Incomprehenſible Myſtery, and a Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth in Theology! And beſides, which is a little wonderful, he does not forget that Myſtery of Myſteries, and ſublimer part of Theology, I mean the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation:</hi> 
                     <q>There is no longer (ſays he to his Novices) Bread or Wine, let your Senſes ſay what they pleaſe, you are not to regard them, but the Teſtimony of Faith. Since J. C. has ſaid of the Bread, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> who dares call it in queſtion? And ſince he has ſaid, <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> who dares ſay it is not? He at other times changed Water into Wine, and is he not to be believed, when he ſays he has changed the Wine into his Blood?</q> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here he acquits himſelf like an Orator and a Sophiſter too. Can any body wonder after this, if the ſtew baptized were deluded into the Belief of the <hi>Trinity</hi> with ſuch Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues as theſe? The Artifice is the ſame in both Caſes.</p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:200403:52"/>
                  <p>Wherefore the Author of the Book of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> takes care to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare theſe two Myſteries, and to prove them, as I may ſay, by one another, ſhewing that what we receive in the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,</hi> is as really the true Fleſh of Chriſt, as he is truly the conſubſtantial Son of God: <q>As Jeſus Chriſt, ſays he, is the true Son of God, and is ſo not only by Grace as Men are, but as he is a Son of the Subſtance of the Father: So it is the Fleſh of Chriſt we receive, and the Blood of Chriſt that we drink. One deep calls upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</q> The Doctrine of the <hi>Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiality,</hi> &amp;c. is the Model and Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> And the firſt ſerves for a Guide and a Light, to conduct you thro the Perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itys and Obſcurities of the laſt, for they are Twin-Siſters, born in <hi>Plato</hi>'s School.</p>
                  <p>That which is remarkable is, that <hi>Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> the firſt of the <hi>Platonizing Fathers,</hi> made the very ſame Compariſon; ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural was it for <hi>Platoniſm</hi> to ſort theſe two Myſterys, and make 'em Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <q>We do not (ſays he, <hi>Apol.</hi> 2.) receive theſe things as common Bread or common Wine: but juſt as by the Word of God Jeſus Chriſt our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was made Man, and took Fleſh and Blood to ſave us; ſo we are taught that the Elements, wherewith our Fleſh and Blood are nouriſhed by the Alteration of them, being confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated by the Power of the Word, are the Fleſh and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt incarnate.</q> The Proteſtant Writers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve from this Paſſage, as Dr. <hi>Stilling-fleet</hi> for one, in the 35 <hi>p.</hi> of his firſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue of the Trinity and Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation compar'd: <q>That <hi>Juſtin</hi> really aſcribes to the ſame <hi>Logos</hi> or Word of God, the <hi>Body</hi> that was in the Womb of the Virgin, and <hi>that Body</hi> which is upon the Altar; and that in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Holy Ghoſt makes the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to become the Body and Blood of Chriſt, not by an Hypoſtatic Union, but by Divine Influence and Operation.</q> But I muſt tell you too, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers underſtood no more than <hi>Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>Influence,</hi> by the <hi>Word</hi> or the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which they ſay did conſecrate the Elements, and change them into the Fleſh and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. So alſo they meant no more than <hi>Influence,</hi> and not a <hi>Perſon,</hi> by the <hi>Word</hi> or the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which formed and ſanctified the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in the Womb of the Virgin, whereby he was properly the Son of God. For why ſhould an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatic Union be rather infer'd from this Paſſage, <hi>The Word was made Fleſh,</hi> than from, <hi>This Bread is my Body?</hi> Either there is an Hypoſtatic Union of the Bread and Fleſh of Chriſt, or there's none at all of the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Fleſh</hi> of Chriſt. By the Power of the Word the Bread becomes the Body of Chriſt; by the ſame Power the Man, or the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> was the Son of God, the Caſe is the ſame. What then is to be done? Why, Myſteries muſt be had at any rate, and the Machines of <hi>Platoniſm</hi> will bring upon the Stage as many as you pleaſe, of the groſſeſt and moſt abſurd: You muſt abandon your Reaſon, 'tis raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be inclined to hearken to Reaſon. Let Reaſon ſubmit herſelf to Faith, and give her alone leave to ſpeak. The <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> require us to abandon our Senſes, but the <hi>Trin—ns</hi> will have us renounce our Reaſon. I am no Chriſtian, in the Judgment of the latter; if I am not a <hi>Brute,</hi> a Brute did I ſay, if I am not a Block. Error is fruitful, and leads us into the groſſeſt Abſurdities, and 'tis the <hi>Syſtem</hi> of theſe Abſurdities that is ſtiled <hi>Theology.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> Of the True Oeconomy.</head>
                  <p>'TIS certain then that the Antients were unacquainted with good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and knew leſs of the true Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy. They believ'd their <hi>Platoniſm,</hi> whereof they were mighty fond, gave 'em great advantages over the Pagan Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, and they us'd it for Reaſons of Prudence: And as they were for the moſt part Gentiles by birth, they knew not the antient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Oeconomy, which would have put 'em in the right way; or it may be, they were rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to purſue their own Bigotries. Their <hi>Oeconomy</hi> is this: As in a Family, the Father and the Son are but One Lord, when the Son rules in the Name, and by the Authority of his Father, who has transfer'd the Exerciſe of that Right to him; 'tis the ſame thing, ſay they, in the Church, which is the Family of God. The Father and the Son are but One, by virtue of that Oeconomy which lodges a Power in the Son's hands, to diſpoſe of the Father's Favours, and to exerciſe all Authority. 'Tis thus <hi>Tertullian</hi> explains the <hi>Oeconomy,</hi> in his Diſcourſe againſt <hi>Praxeas.</hi> He ſhews him, that he does not deſtroy the Notion of a Monarchy, or the Government of <hi>One</hi> over the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, becauſe the Father may exerciſe it by the Miniſtry of his Son, or ſuch as he ſhall think fit to ſubſtitute in his room, as, the Angels, his Officers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners: but chiefly becauſe the Son does nothing but at the Will of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with a Power he has receiv'd. Which is evident even from this, that he ſhall one day ſurrender it to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the Apoſtle tells us, and the Son himſelf ſhall be ſubject to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lactantius</hi> purſues exactly the Steps of <hi>Tertullian</hi> (in <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 29.) <q>When a Father, ſays he, has a Son whom he dearly loves, giving him the Title of Lord, with Authority; if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, this Son continues in his Father's Houſe under him, it may be ſaid however, according to the Civil Law, that 'tis but one Houſe, and one Maſter or Lord. So this World is but one Houſe or Family, and the Father, and the Son who governs it with the Father's Conſent, are but One God; ſince that <hi>One</hi> is <hi>as Two,</hi> and the <hi>Two</hi> as <hi>One.</hi> And 'tis not to be wonder'd at, ſeeing that the Son is in the Father, becauſe the Father loves the Son: And the Father is in the Son, becauſe the Son obeys faithfully the Father's Will, and does nothing but what the Father wills, or commands him.</q> God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſhews, may communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his Right to all intelligent Creatures, and uſe in a way of condeſcenſion their Miniſtry, to make himſelf known to his Children: For as he is by his Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible, his Supreme Majeſty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing far above all his Creatures, he ſtoops as it were by this Method to their ſhallow Capacities. 'Tis thus at other times that he us'd the Miniſtry of Angels, and at that day the Miniſtry of a Man, whom he made his Son, and Heir of his Houſe. In ſhort, this Diſpenſation by his Son under the New Teſtament, differs not from that of the Angels in the old Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration; only in this, that the latter was temporary and proviſional, but that of Chriſt is perpetual. The Angels exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd <hi>their Oeconomy,</hi> as Miniſters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion'd and delegated; <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> exerciſes <hi>his</hi> in the capacity of a Son and Heir, who continnes always in the Houſe or Family. <hi>They who know</hi> the antient
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:200403:53"/>Oeconomy to be ſuch, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Stephen</hi> have diſcover'd it to be, who acquaint us that 'twas Angels, or an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, which gave the Law, and ſaid, <hi>I am the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I am the God of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They, I ſay, were in no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of believing that 'twas the Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible and Inviſible God who appear'd to the <hi>Jews:</hi> They were aſſur'd that it was none other than <hi>his Angel, his Word, his Face,</hi> or <hi>his Perſon,</hi> by which he made himſelf to be ſeen and underſtood; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating himſelf by this Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Weakneſs of Men, who could not ſee God, and live. But they who comprehended not this Oeconomy of Goodneſs and Condeſcenſion, groſly fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied this Angel to be an uncreated One, as they call'd him, or the Supreme God himſelf. As if it were not the groſſeſt abſurdity to imagine, that the Supreme God had put his Name upon the Supreme God. If this Angel was really <hi>Jehovah</hi> by Nature, could he receive this Name from another? Has he, in his Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, occaſion for another Name, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Authority beſides his own?</p>
                  <p>The ſame Miſtake has happen'd with regard to the true Oeconomy by Jeſus Chriſt. The Myſtery and Secret (of the Diſpenſation) being not known, that Man has been taken for the Supreme God, or an uncreated Angel, who was born of a Virgin, baptized with the Holy Ghoſt, and inveſted with the Power of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who is that Word and that Oracle, by which the Father has been pleas'd to ſpeak to us in theſe laſt days: His Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy being no longer to reveal himſelf by the Angels, but in the Fleſh of his Son, the viſible Image of the Inviſible God, the <hi>Face,</hi> the <hi>Character,</hi> or the <hi>Perſon (as he is called)</hi> of the Subſtance of the Father. And thus we Chriſtians have but <hi>One God,</hi> who in the way of Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy governs his Family by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of an Inferiour: and but <hi>One Lord,</hi> who by this Oeconomy manages the ſame Family in the Name of his Superiour.</p>
                  <p>There's a Tract among St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Works, (intitul'd, <hi>De eo quod dictum eſt, Ego ſum qui ſum</hi>) which admirably well explains this matter, without that mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Platoniſm</hi> that <hi>Lactantius</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> have, in Paſſages hereafter cited. <q>They, ſays that Author (making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf one of them, who would have it to be an Angel, that call'd himſelf <hi>Jehova</hi>) ought to give us a reaſon why he calls himſelf ſo. They anſwer, that as 'tis ſaid in the Scripture, that the Lord ſpoke, when the Prophet ſpoke, not that the Prophet was the Lord, but becauſe the Lord was in the Prophet: So when the Lord vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafes to ſpeak by an Angel, as by a Prophet or an Apoſtle, this Angel may very well be called an Angel upon his own account, and the Lord with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to God dwelling in him.—The ſame who ſpeaks in the Man, ſpeaks in the Angel; wherefore the Angel of God who appeared to <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaid, <hi>I am what I am.</hi>
                     </q> This is not the Voice of the Temple, <hi>as he may be called,</hi> but of him who dwelt in it. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, he having ſhewn, that the Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions of Angels in the Old Teſtament, cannot be underſtood of Jeſus Chriſt, he adds, <q>I ſuppoſe we ſhall underſtand this matter better, by ſaying, that our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers own'd the Lord that it was in the Angels, or the Being who dwelt in thoſe whom he imploy'd; and ſo give Glory to the Lord who was perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Angels, and not to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels who did perſonate him. This Truth, ſays he, is confirm'd by the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where 'tis ſaid,—<hi>the Word ſpoke by Angels</hi>—whereby the Apoſtle reaches us, that they were Angels who ſpoke, but that God was heard and honoured in the Angels. We are told the ſame truth in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> where St. <hi>Stephen</hi> reproving the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſays to 'em, <hi>Ye ſtiff-necked,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>who received the Law by the diſpoſition of Angels, and have not kept it.</hi> If <hi>Stephen</hi> had ſaid, of <hi>an Angel,</hi> and not, of <hi>Angels,</hi> there
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:200403:53"/>would be no need of ſaying farther, this is Jeſus Chriſt, who is call'd <hi>the Angel of Great Counſel.</hi> Call him one Angel as much as you pleaſe, but can one call him Angels? —'Twas there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore One Angel, and the Lord in that Angel, who ſaid to <hi>Moſes</hi> that ask'd his Name, <hi>I am what I am.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are the ſame Proofs and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s <hi>3d</hi> Book <hi>de Trinit.</hi> who obſerves, <q>That 'twas ſaid [An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels] and not [one Angel] in the Singular; that it might not be ſaid that it was the Son of God.</q> And putting to himſelf this Objection, <q>Why do we read, <hi>God ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, and not the Angel ſaid unto <hi>Moſes?</hi> He replys, As we ſay, the Judg ſpeaks when the Crier publiſhes; the Lord ſaid, when the Prophet ſpoke: So tho the Angel ſpoke, the Word is aſcrib'd to God, who imploy'd him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame <hi>Father</hi> arguing ſtrongly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe who believ'd that Jeſus Chriſt appeared to the antient Patriarchs, has theſe Words, <hi>Lib.</hi> 16. <hi>cap.</hi> 29. <hi>de Civit. Dei.</hi> 
                     <q>God, ſays he, appeared to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> in the Perſon of three Men, that were without queſtion three An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, tho ſome imagin'd that one of 'em was Jeſus Chriſt: But if Jeſus Chriſt be pretended to be one of the three, becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> addreſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to one of 'em; why is it not minded, that the third who ſtaid with <hi>Abraham,</hi> is called Lord, and one of the other two who came to <hi>Lot,</hi> is call'd Lord too in the Singular by the Patriarch, when he makes anſwer to the Lord, who was in the two Angels? Therefore 'tis much more likely, that <hi>Abraham</hi> underſtood the Lord to be in the three Men, and that <hi>Lot</hi> thought him preſent in the two.</q> There's the ſame arguing to be met with in St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>'s <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Trinit. c.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>This Oeconomy of Angels, as you ſee, gives great light to the new Oeconomy of Jeſus Chriſt, and opens a way for our underſtanding it. For 'tis but to apply to this laſt Diſpenſation all that thoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have ſaid of the Angels, and we ſhall have a Key to underſtand the Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the New Teſtament, which ſpeak of Jeſus Chriſt as of God himſelf. We need ſay no more than this, that Jeſus in himſelf was a Man, and a God with reſpect to God dwelling in him: So that the Man is not <hi>the Lord Jehovah,</hi> but <hi>the Lord</hi> is in the Man; and whatever Name he has, or Power he claims, 'tis not <hi>the Voice of the Temple,</hi> but of him who dwelt in it. In ſhort, all that has been ſaid of the Angel, may it not be ſaid of the Man, except this, that there are two Natures in him? And if the Angel might aſſume the Names and Characters of <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> without being concluded to be him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the <hi>Jehovah,</hi> why may not the like Names and Characters be given Chriſt, without concluding thence that he is the <hi>Supreme God?</hi> This Reflection ſinks the great Objection of the Trinitarians, their modiſh Argument, I had almoſt ſaid; for 'tis the beaten Track of the modern Diſputants. How ſtrange muſt it be, ſay they, for the New Teſtament Writers, if they did not look upon Jeſus Chriſt to be the Supreme God, to ſpeak of him, as of God himſelf? Would thoſe Holy Men have led us into ſo great an Error by their extravagant Forms of ſpeaking, if it were not ſo? But this ambulatory way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing is pure Declamation, and may be ruin<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Hiſt. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 28. did ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the Praiſes of Jeſus Chriſt, the <hi>Word of God,</hi> by aſcribing to him <hi>Divinity.</hi> But after the Philoſophy of <hi>Plato</hi> was received in the <hi>Church,</hi> the Writers of the ſecond and third Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury are not wont to ſpeak of Jeſus Chriſt with ſo much ſimplicity, as barely to call him <hi>God.</hi> This manner of ſpeaking of Jeſus Chriſt has the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> his time, who ſimply or barely call'd him God. <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> reproaches <hi>Clemens Romanus,</hi> for not giving the Title of God to Jeſus Chriſt, which ſo well became him. Hence it appears that this able Critick thought the Practice of giving Chriſt the Title of a God, was peculiar to this firſt Age of the Church. But the Title [God] ſo often given to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:200403:54"/>Chriſt by <hi>Ignatius,</hi> tho not with the reſtriction with which 'tis done by the ſucceeding Fathers, but ſimply and by it ſelf, is indeed a mark of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of St. <hi>Clemens</hi> his Writings. He imitates throughout the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which had been received from the beginning in all Churches; but he rarely cites the Goſpels, which had been more lately received. He has nothing in his Epiſtles of human Learning, nothing that does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Simplicity of an Apoſtolick Man, and the Purity of the Goſpel. They who wrote after him uſually bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and ſometimes blend their Opinions with the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, which every one did, according to the Principles of that Philoſophy they had imbib'd before they embrac'd Chriſtianity. <hi>Ignatius</hi> had for a long time been a Biſhop, and became a Chriſtian at a time when very few of the Learned Gentiles turn'd Chriſtians; but we find him to be <hi>purely the Chriſtian,</hi> not form'd in the Schools, or nurs'd up in Librarys, and without the Sentiments of the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my or the <hi>Portico.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Bp <hi>Pearſon</hi> acquaints us in this fine Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, that the Antients did <hi>theologize</hi> (that is, attribute Divinity to) Jeſus Chriſt, and ſpoke of him as a God. This taken in a good Senſe, very well explains what they underſtood by the title of a God, when they gave it to Jeſus Chriſt. They meant nothing elſe by it, but this, that they look'd upon him as a <hi>Divine and extraordinary Man,</hi> and that they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd him as ſuch. In ſhort, it would not be proper to ſay, that the Antients ſang Hymns to the <hi>Father</hi> as to a God <hi>(quaſi Deo)</hi> that they celebrated the Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the <hi>Father,</hi> by aſcribing Divinity to him, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, deifying him; this would be ridiculous Language. We don't uſe to ſpeak thus of the Supreme God. Theſe Expreſſions cannot ſute any other Object, but one, who has not <hi>Divinity</hi> in an abſolute Senſe, but in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reſpects only. And 'tis upon the following accounts that Jeſus Chriſt was ſpoken of as a God, either with regard to his <hi>Nature,</hi> being the Son of God, form'd by the Operation of his Spirit; or with regard to his <hi>Dignity, ſince that the Father by making him Lord and Chriſt, had made him God,</hi> as St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> reads this Paſſage (<hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de fide ad Grat. Aug. Cap.</hi> 7.) 'Tis true, this Term [<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>] in another ſenſe is ſometimes us'd with reſpect to God the Father; but then it ſignifies nothing elſe, but to ſpeak with reverence of the Deity, to celebrate his Praiſes, and not to <hi>deify,</hi> or <hi>aſcribe Divinity to him. Vide Euſeb. Hiſt. Eccleſ. lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. In the firſt of the Senſes abovementioned, the term may be well applied to Jeſus Chriſt, to expreſs the Divine Honours they gave him. For if he was Man, becauſe a Woman was his Mother, it might alſo be ſaid, that he was a God, and a God by Nature; for being born of a Virgin, he had none other Father but God <hi>(Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura a naſcendo.)</hi> But he deſerves this high Character yet further, foraſmuch as the Father has highly exalted him, and given him a Name above every Name. By this Name, ſays <hi>Novatian de Trinit. cap.</hi> 17. we underſtand nothing elſe but the Name of <hi>God.</hi> Becauſe he was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſays <hi>Lactantius, Inſtitut. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. and had exactly done the Will of his Father, he received the Name (or Title) of <hi>God.</hi> 'Tis in this ſenſe, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the ſecond Epiſtle aſcrib'd to <hi>Clemens Romanus,</hi> exhorts us to think of Chriſt, <hi>as of a God</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) and he explains that by ſubjoining, as <hi>of the Judg of Quick and Dead.</hi> Shewing us thereby, that he gave him not that Name, but with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Power the Father beſtowed upon him, for his Obedience.</p>
                  <p>This is the very Theology of St. <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 1. who tells us, that God <hi>made Chriſt more excellent than the Angels,</hi> when he ſaid to him, <hi>thou art my Son,</hi> that is plainly, that then he <hi>made him a God:</hi> For 'tis of his Exaltation the Apoſtle
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:200403:55"/>ſpeaks, as appears by his Citation out of the Pſalms, <hi>O God, thy God has anointed thee;</hi> for ſo I read it, as the Trinitarians do. Now a God anointed and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, is nothing but a King; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently Jeſus Chriſt is God with regard to the Dominion he has received from the Father over the New Creation. But with reſpect to <hi>God the Father,</hi> he is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Miniſter of his Will. If he be called Lord, that's no more than a Term of <hi>Inferiority</hi> in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſignifies one whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath appointed his <hi>Vicegerent;</hi> and it cannot be underſtood otherwiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis ſaid, <hi>the Father has made him Lord.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> exactly follows this Senſe; for in all the Symbols he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he takes care to aſcribe the Name of God only to the Father, excluding the Son, and ſaying, the Father is the One God, and the Son the One Lord; which St. <hi>Paul</hi> does always, when he ſpeaks of Father and Son together. And this is an Obſervation I had from <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who ſpeaks thus in his Diſpute againſt <hi>Praxeas:</hi> 
                     <q>I will not ſay <hi>two Gods</hi> and <hi>two Lords,</hi> but I will follow the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul;</hi> and if the Father and the Son are to be nam'd together, I'll call the Father <hi>God,</hi> and Jeſus Chriſt <hi>Lord.</hi> But if Jeſus Chriſt be named alone, then I may call him <hi>God,</hi> as the Apoſtle himſelf does, when he ſays, <hi>Of whom is Chriſt, who is God over all things, bleſſed for ever.</hi>
                     </q> But in my opinion <hi>Novation</hi> expreſſes the thing more clearly in his Diſcourſe <hi>de Trinitate, cap. ult.</hi> 
                     <q>God the Father, ſays he, is without contradiction the God of all, and the very Principle of his Son, whom he has made <hi>Lord.</hi> But the <hi>Son</hi> is the God of all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>becauſe God the Father has ſet him at their Head, when he made him Lord.</hi>
                     </q> Whence it follows that Jeſus Chriſt may well be called God, when you conſider him at the head of the New Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which God has ſubjected to his Dominion. But this Title vaniſhes, when the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> is ſpeaking of the Father and the Son together; then the Son can have no other Character but what is fully ſignified and explain'd in the Notion of God's Miniſter and Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. So true is it, that before the only True and Supreme God, every other Deity muſt fall down, and diſappear. So that Bp <hi>Pearſon</hi> had reaſon to ſay, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> imitates St. <hi>Paul;</hi> for he ſays in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt <hi>was made God in the Fleſh;</hi> which can ſignify no more than that a Man was raiſed to Divine Power or Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Moreover, <hi>Ignatius</hi> gives Jeſus Chriſt the Title of <hi>[God]</hi> without any of thoſe Additions, which the Fathers after him make uſe of. He does not call Chriſt, in the <hi>Platonick</hi> Stile, <hi>God the Word, a God begotten, God of God.</hi> But if it ſhould be ſaid, <hi>Ignatius</hi> has not uſed the Reſtrictions of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and that he calls Chriſt <hi>God</hi> ſimply and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely; this is not true, for he calls him a <hi>God made,</hi> or <hi>our God,</hi> to ſhew, that he is not ſo, but with regard to the Power he received of his Father, and exerciſes over us.</p>

                  <p>THAT the moſt Primitive Fathers gave the Title of God to J. C. in the ſenſe I am about to explain, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for three Reaſons, which amount almoſt to Demonſtration. My firſt Reaſon is taken from the manner, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Clem. Rom.</hi> and <hi>Polycarp</hi> ſpeak of J. C. <hi>Photius</hi> ſays, that <hi>Clement</hi> has given our Saviour the Stile of High Prieſt, but reproaches him for not giving Chriſt the Characters of a God. Is it poſſible that <hi>Clement</hi> has done J. C. ſo great an Injury, as not to give him the Character he merits? By no means. <hi>Photius</hi> is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, and 'tis contrary to all reaſon to imagine ſo conſiderable an Omiſſion can be found in a Letter, wherein the Church at <hi>Rome</hi> (as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> tells us, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2.) delivers to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the Tradition ſhe had received from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. It muſt be ſaid therefore that this great Critick <hi>[Photius]</hi> did not take notice, that in the Apoſtolic Stile of St. <hi>Clement,</hi> the calling J. C. our High Prieſt and Pontif is the ſame thing, as to call him our God; agreeable to the Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who teaches us, that when God rais'd his <hi>Meſſias</hi> to the Honour of the High Prieſthood, 'twas then he ſaid unto him, <hi>Thou art my Son, this Day have I begotten thee.</hi> So that there's nothing in my Opinion more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and juſt, than the Remark of <hi>Grotius, Epiſt.</hi> 347. <hi>Par.</hi> 2. who proves the Antiquity of this Epiſtle of St. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for this very reaſon, becauſe it does not ſpeak of J. C. in the <hi>Platonic</hi> Way and Manner, as was done by others in after Ages, but in a Simplicity or Plainneſs, altogether as St. <hi>Paul</hi> had ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>As to St. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> one finds in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle the ſame Character of Simplicity and Plainneſs, as in St. <hi>Clement</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, which <hi>Photius</hi> takes notice of in the place forecited. And St. <hi>Irenaeus, l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3. gives <hi>Polycarp</hi>'s Epiſtle this fair Character, <hi>That 'tis a moſt compleat and very proper Inſtruction in the Faith, and Doctrine of Truth.</hi> Yet one meets with no <hi>Platonic</hi> Titles in this excellent Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. In vain will you look for theſe Phraſes, <hi>the [Eternal] Word, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtence of the Son of God, the Generation from the Womb of the Father,</hi> &amp;c. Nay you will not find in this Epiſtle, ſo much as the Name of God applied to Chriſt. Where then, with reſpect to Chriſt, are <hi>Polycarp</hi>'s Characters of the true Faith and Doctrine? Why they are in thoſe Elogies, which <hi>Polycarp</hi> often repeats, as that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the everlaſting High Prieſt, that he is the Son of God, that the Father hath rais'd him from the Dead, and made him to ſit at his right Hand.</hi> For pray obſerve St. <hi>Polycarp</hi>'s Creed of the <hi>Divinity of the Father and the Son:</hi> 
                     <q>To paſs over (ſays he) the Miſtake and Babble of ſome Perſons; let us believe in him who rais'd our Lord Jeſus Chriſt from the Dead, and hath crowned him with Glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let us keep our ſelves clear of the vain and falſe Doctrine of thoſe Perſons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:200403:56"/>and keep cloſe to the antient Tradition and Word, which was left us from the beginning.</q> In which Paſſage this Holy Perſon, being willing to put the <hi>Philippians</hi> in mind of the vain Diſcourſe of ſome, and to guide 'em to the ſource of true Tradition, which he makes to conſiſt in believing J. C. was deified by his Father, he meant no doubt to bring them off from the vain Philoſophy of <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Second God,</hi> and to engage them to that Divinity of J. C. which is founded on his Exaltation. For 'tis clear that <hi>Polycarp</hi> ealls here by the Name of true and antient Tradition, this ſummary of the Faith expreſſed in theſe Terms, <hi>Believe ye in him who hath raiſed Jeſus Chriſt our Lord from the Dead,</hi> &amp;c. This Symbol is agreeable to that of the Apoſtles, and is directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to that vain Doctrine he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to condemn. And this Symbol in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting upon nothing but the Glory J. C. acquired by his Sufferings, it muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follow, that under the Name of Babble or vain Doctrine, St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> cenſures that vain and falſe Glory, which <hi>Platonizing</hi> Chriſtians aſcribed to Chriſt by their fancied Pre-exiſtence. In ſhort, inſtead of that unintelligible Babble of other Fathers, and I know not what Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, of a Son of God begotten before all Ages, and emanated from the Divine Mind, which is exactly the reverſe of the Goſpel; <hi>Polycarp</hi> here ſpeaks of none other Son of God, but one who is an everlaſting High Prieſt, rais'd to a Sovereign Glory; which is the real Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, the Tradition of the Apoſtles, and the antient Theology.</p>
                  <p>My ſecond Proof is drawn from the Conſeſſion of the antient Martyrs; there can be no doubt but that thoſe faithful Witneſſes of J. C. gave his Perſon the moſt illuſtrious and moſt honourable Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony that they could, and that they heighten'd their <hi>Theology</hi> as far as they could, without the hezard of their Faith.

                     <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> was a Witneſs very credible both with <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that Jeſus was really the Chriſt. His Confeſſion is not long, however it comprehends that which may be ſaid to be the moſt auguſt and conſiderable, and confirms all the Theology which concerns the Perſons of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>To theſe Teſtimonies of antient Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, give me leave to add another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which is not much from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. <hi>Euſebius</hi> tells us in his <hi>Eccleſ. Hiſt. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 13. <q>That <hi>Thaddeus</hi> going to ſee King <hi>Agbarus,</hi> he preached to the King J. C. our Lord and our God, the Meſſias, or the Sent of God.</q> 
                     <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſius</hi> remarks in his Notes, that the Word [God] is wanting in good Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, which are in other Paſſages con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by <hi>Nicephorus</hi> and <hi>Ruffinus:</hi> 
                     <q>And I don't think, ſays Monſ. <hi>Valois,</hi> any one dares deny, but that the Reading, wherein the Word <hi>God</hi> is wanting, is more agreeable to the Text: For <hi>1ſt</hi> the Antients us'd not that Word but of the Father only. <hi>2ly.</hi> If <hi>Thaddeus</hi> ſpeaking to a King, who was a new Convert to and weak in the Faith, had call'd J. C. God, this might have perplexed him, and made him to think that two Gods were preached to him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis plain and fair dealing to affirm, the Antients by no means gave the Name of God to J. C. but 'tis mincing to ſay that they did it not in the caſe of weak Chriſtians, this is a mere Evaſion. For why was not the like Tenderneſs us'd towards others in the following Ages? Is it becauſe there was leſs danger of ſpreading <hi>Polytheiſm?</hi> Were not the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumens</hi> both weak and Novices too, whom the <hi>Pantaenuſſes,</hi> the <hi>Clements Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinuſſes,</hi> the <hi>Origens,</hi> and the <hi>Cyrils</hi> taught the ſecond God of <hi>Plato,</hi> with all the Niceties of the myſtic Theology?</p>
                  <p>Be that as it will, it appears from this Paſſage and many others, that one has not good ground to truſt much to the Teſtimonies of the Antients, where the Name of God is given to J. C. The Word God has been inſerted in ſuch Places by <hi>Trinitarian Copiſts,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt many other Terms have been retrench'd, as they thought fit. What an Abyſs of Uncertainty is here then! Beſides, Monſ. <hi>Du Pin</hi> believes this Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of <hi>Thaddeus</hi> to be fabulous (<hi>See his Biblioth. Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 1.) <hi>Euſebius</hi> has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſſed all ſorts of Memoirs without much Judgment: He often miſunderſtands the Authors he cites, ſometimes he corrupts them to reconcile them to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Scheme.</hi> What endleſs Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties muſt this occaſion! Monſ. <hi>Valois</hi> himſelf falls under the ſame Guilt he taxes in others; and we muſt not only be upon our Guard againſt the Fraud of <hi>Copiſts,</hi> but of <hi>Tranſlators</hi> too. Obſerve how he reads the Text, in the eleventh Chapter of the eighth Book of <hi>Euſeb. Eecleſ. Hiſt.</hi> 
                     <q>The Martyrs of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> as he makes the Hiſtorian word it, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon Jeſus Chriſt, who is God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all.</q> Now theſe Words [<hi>God over all</hi>] are not found in the Greek of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopherſon,</hi> nor in the Latin Verſion of <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> nor in <hi>Couſin</hi>'s French Verſion. And <hi>Valois</hi> takes no notice whence he had this Reading, which in other Places is ſo contrary to the Doctrine of <hi>Euſebius</hi> himſelf, and to other Invocations to be met with in great Numbers in his Hiſtory: the ordinary Form thereof is, to invoke him, who is God over all, by or through J. C. our Lord; and in ſhort is contrary to the Uſage and conſtant Practice of the Primitive Church, as we are going to ſhew in our third Proof.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> A Continuation of the Proofs, that the firſt Fathers did not deify Chriſt upon any other account, but that of his miraculous Birth and Exaltation.</head>
                  <p>I Affirm in the third Place, that the Antients grounded their Deifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of J. C. upon nothing beyond his <hi>being born</hi> of a Virgin, and his Exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the higheſt Heavens; and that for this deciſive Reaſon, <hi>becauſe they held all thoſe were Hereticks, who gave J. C. the Title of God over all.</hi> To this purpoſe ſpeaks the Author of the <hi>Apoſtolic Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 26. <q>There are ſome, ſays he, who have the Impiety, or are ſo impious as to ſay, that <hi>J. C. is God over all;</hi> fancying that he is the Father himſelf, and at the ſame time both Son and Paraclet.</q> Can any thing be conceived more execrable? Upon this Paſſage Monſ. <hi>Daille</hi> in his <hi>Pſeudepigr. Apoſt.</hi> bleſſes himſelf, and ſays, Then was St. <hi>Paul</hi> an Heretick, and the whole Church is heretical, which conſtantly maintain'd againſt the <hi>Arians,</hi> that J. C. was God over all. So that heretofore 'twas <hi>Hereſy</hi> to affirm J. C. to be God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all, tho now-a-days 'tis <hi>Orthodoxy.</hi> But that Chriſt was the Father himſelf, and the Son and Paraclet too, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence drawn from their Doctrine, which they rejected without doubt, as 'tis diſavowed by others in theſe days. The diſtinction of Perſons was not then in faſhion, which is nothing but three dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Names for the ſame thing, as that word is now underſtood. For it muſt ſignify with ſome nothing but a <hi>Mode,</hi> a Relation, a <hi>neſcio q<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>d.</hi> which are words that ſignify nothing leſs than what we commonly call a Perſon, Wherefore If the conſequence above be good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the antient Hereticks, 'tis e'en as good againſt the modern <hi>Sabellians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the Author of the Conſtitutions I place <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who in his Epiſtle to thoſe of <hi>Tarſus,</hi> calls thoſe Hereticks Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Satan, who held theſe two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes; the one, that J. C. is God over all; the other, that he was but a mere Man. In his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> he explains wherein Orthodoxy truly conſiſts, <hi>viz.</hi> in believing Chriſt born of God by a Virgin; for not only they who believed him a mere Man, denied this Truth, but <hi>Ignatius</hi> farther inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, that this Truth was denied no leſs even by ſuch, who believed him to be <hi>God over all.</hi> 
                     <q>How, ſays he to them, do you not believe that J. C. was born of a Virgin, but that <hi>he is God over all,</hi> I would ſay, him who can do all things? Tell me then I pray, who is he that ſent him? To whoſe Will is he ſubject? And whoſe Law did he fulfil? How dare you maintain that the Chriſt was by no means gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, that the Lawgiver is unbegotten, and that he who is without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was nail'd to a Croſs?</q> This Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is the cleareſt Proof. The Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of J. C. by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt, was the true Theology concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Perſon; and thoſe who held him to be the Supreme God, conteſted this miraculous Generation, pretending that he was unbegotten. For this reaſon <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> adds a little after, <q>This is not he who is God over all, but the Son, meaning thereby, one who was begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</q>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:200403:57"/>
                     <hi>Daille</hi> exclaims upon the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage aforeſaid, ſaying, <q>
                        <hi>Ignatius</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes the Son from that God who is over all, which is Blaſphemy.</q> And he has reaſon (to ſpeak in the Orthodox way) becauſe the Character of a God over all, is not properly of the Perſon, but an Attribute of the Subſtance. So that it cannot be taken from J. C. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out robbing him of the Divine Nature and Subſtance.</p>
                  <p>It will be ſaid perhaps, that the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions</hi> are not <hi>Clement</hi>'s, and that the two Epiſtles under the Name of <hi>Ignatius</hi> are falſly aſcribed to him. But this is trifling as to our Queſtion; for be it as it will, my Citations are from Authors of great Antiquity, and who paſs for <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians:</hi> they are Witneſſes of the Faith in that Age wherein they lived, and whoſe Teſtimony conſequently ought not to be ſuſpected by us Moderns. So much the rather, becauſe the ſame is confirmed by a Doctor of great Name and Reputation. For is it not well known, that <hi>Origen</hi> attacked the ſame Error, in his 32 <hi>Tom.</hi> on St. <hi>John,</hi> and in his eighth Book againſt <hi>Celſus?</hi> Monſ. <hi>Huet</hi> in his <hi>Quaeſtiones Origen.</hi> 2. is much ſcandalized, that <hi>Origen</hi> ſhould ſay, <q>Some maintained that Chriſt was God over all; This Propoſition, ſaith <hi>Huet,</hi> is true and Orthodox, with reſpect to the Divine, not the Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</q> 
                     <hi>Origen</hi> on the contrary, denies our Saviour to be God over all, and proves him to be inferiour to the Father by this Reaſon, becauſe the Father is God over all. He takes away then from the Divine Nature of J. C. the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of ſupreme Divinity, and aſcribes it to the Father. But let us hear <hi>Origen</hi> himſelf: <q>I mean, ſays he, that there are <hi>ſome among the great Number</hi> of Believers, who widely differing from the Opinion of others, <hi>raſhly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that our Saviour is God over all: for our parts we have no regard for that Opinion, believing theſe Words of our Saviour himſelf,</hi> viz. <hi>The Father why ſent me is greater than I.</hi>
                     </q> 'Tis trifling to anſwer here, that <hi>Origen</hi> meant ſome Hereticks, who held that J. C. was the Father. This takes not off from the Force of the Argument; for <hi>Origen</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that the Son is not the Father, for this reaſon, becauſe he is not as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, God over all; and becauſe Chriſt himſelf confeſſes, that the Father is greater than himſelf, ſuppoſing that it was the Father alone who had this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Prerogative.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> in his <hi>Judicium Eccleſ. Cath.</hi> and his <hi>Defender</hi> in his <hi>Fathers vindicated,</hi> citing the famous Paſſage of <hi>Juſtin,</hi> when that Father conſents to a Toleration of the <hi>Joſephites</hi> (who believed Jeſus to be the Son of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> yet nevertheleſs believed him to be Chriſt) Theſe Authors, I ſay, inſiſt much upon the oppoſition which <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> makes between <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>CHAP IV.</hi> General Remarks upon the forecited Authorities of the Fathers.</head>
                  <p>IT remains that I make two Remarks upon theſe Paſſages in general; one is, that ſince 'twas Hereſy in theſe firſt times of Chriſtianity, to affirm that J. C. is the ſupreme God; it follows that Orthodoxy was either the Opinion of <hi>Arius,</hi> which will not be granted, or that of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> which ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ſince 'tis taken from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by the Confeſſion of the <hi>Trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other Remark is, ſince ſuch Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers condemn this Expreſſion as hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Lord Jeſus is God over all, without taking any notice of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection now drawn from that Paſſage in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. which one wou'd think was very natural for them to have ſolv'd; it follows that in their time either they gave thoſe Words another ſenſe, or that they read it otherwiſe than we do at this day.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſing then, as I am about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that to aſcribe to J. C. the Prerogative of the Father, <hi>viz.</hi> of being God over all, was Hereſy in the firſt Ages of the Church; One ſees clearly in what ſenſe a Remark of <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> may be true, which was this, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all Chriſtians in <hi>Paleſtine</hi> in the time of <hi>Adrian,</hi> believed Jeſus Chriſt to be a God. Not the ſupreme God, as <hi>Sulpitius</hi> pretends, nor a God begotten a little before the Creation, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> would have us believe, by perverting ſome Paſſages of the <hi>Antients,</hi> and by making them to ſerve his own Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Not, I ſay once more, the ſupreme God; this would have been a damnable Error. What then? Why <hi>a God,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was received or owned not only as a Juſt Man and a Prophet, but as the Chriſt of God, whom he made <hi>Lord,</hi> giving him a Name above every Name, the Name of God. Note here the manner of Chriſt's Deification. In ſhort, one cannot believe without Hereſy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe Primitive Doctors, that he was a mere Man, having no more Authority than other Holy Perſons. One cannot therefore better ſtate the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy of thoſe venerable Doctors, than in avoiding theſe two Extremes. And we find it to be ſo, in the moſt famous and moſt antient Monument of the Chriſtian Church, I mean the Apoſtles Creed, which ſays, I believe in J. C. the only Son [of God] our Lord; how I pray is he God's only Son? Why that's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd in theſe Words, he was conceiv'd by the Holy Ghoſt, and born of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, his miraculous Generation and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity made him a God: and how he became our Lord, appears in theſe Words, he was raiſed from the Dead and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into Heaven, whence he ſhall come to judge the Quick and the Dead; his Obedience and his illuſtrious Vertue rais'd him to this ſupreme Dignity. Theſe two Articles make up the whole of the antient Theology, with reſpect to the Perſon of Chriſt; but the latter of the two without diſpute was the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and is only inſiſted on for our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. J. C. never preach'd to the <hi>Jews</hi> his miraculous Birth, but he always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Miſſion from Heaven by Miracles wrought publickly and openly. The Apoſtles in the Hiſtory we have of their firſt Sermons, have ſpoken nothing more; they inſiſt not on any other To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pic concerning their Divine Maſter, but
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:200403:58"/>thoſe of his Reſurrection and Exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. St. <hi>Paul</hi> loſt his Life for preaching that laſt Myſtery. But in how many Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages does he preſs, as eſſential and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, the Belief of Chriſt's Exaltation? <hi>If thou confeſſeſt with thy Mouth, that Jeſus is the Lord, and believeſt with thy Heart, that God hath rais'd him from the Dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> Rom. 10.9.</p>
                  <p>The earlieſt Antiquity was of the ſame Judgment, as it appears by two Inſtances: The firſt is that of <hi>Victor</hi> Bp of <hi>Rome,</hi> who excommunicated <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> altho he believed J. C. was born of a Virgin by the Holy Spirit, becauſe (as is remarked by the Author of a Catalogue of Hereſies, ſuppos'd to be <hi>Tertullian</hi>) <hi>Theodotus</hi> believed Chriſt to be a <hi>mere Man,</hi> who had no other Advantage or Prerogative above other Men, but what he had from his own Righteouſneſs. This is plainly to ſay, that tho he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him a Man extraordinary in his Birth and his Vertue, yet he did not therefore believe him to be that Chriſt and that Lord, whom the Father had rais'd above all other Men, and even above Angels; whereby <hi>Theodotus</hi> rejected a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Article of Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>The other Inſtance is that of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> in his Dialogue with <hi>Trypho.</hi> He there owns for his Brethren, that there were ſome Chriſtians of his time, who held for a Truth that J. C. was but a mere Man, the Son of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> but however believed him to be the Chriſt: which plainly intimates, that they did not look upon him barely as a Prophet, who only preached Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the <hi>Jews;</hi> but beſides, they thought him to be the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſent to all Nations, and the Lord whom God had made ſuch over all Men; and in this they retain'd the fundamental Article of Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>After this Opinions changed, as <hi>Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> before cited has remarked: <q>Thoſe, ſays he, who wrote juſt after the purer Ages of the Church, borrowed the Sentiments of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them with the Chriſtian Religion, following thoſe Principles of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, which they had imbibed before they embraced the Chriſtian Religion.</q> That was the ſource of the enſuing Evils; the Exaltation of our Saviour, which had been eſteemed the chief point in Chriſtianity, as we have ſeen in the Writings of <hi>Polycarp</hi> and <hi>Clement,</hi> was no longer regarded as ſuch: But his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Birth was the only Article inſiſted upon. The Reaſon whereof is plainly this, that in their Diſputes with the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, they did not ſo much inſiſt upon the High Offices of the Meſſias, as upon the Excellency of his Nature and Perſon; for they wanted a Parallel with the <hi>emanated Word</hi> of the Philoſophers. And indeed this miraculous Birth was much more ſutable to the Principles of <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> which enter'd into the Chriſtian Religion, upon the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſome Learned Men. An holy Spirit coming down from Heaven upon a Virgin, and begetting in her that holy Man, who from that is ſtiled the Son of God: An Event, I ſay, ſo extraordinary as this, was without doubt the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per thing in all that Goſpel, to ſerve for a Foundation of the <hi>Platonic</hi> Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; 'twas eaſy, with a little philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phic Dexterity, to find in it the <hi>ſecond God,</hi> the <hi>begotten Son,</hi> the <hi>Son of God,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Mind</hi> or <hi>

Thus by the force of a philoſophic Management, of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Generation of the Son of God by the Operation of the Holy Spirit, this Point at laſt was changed into that of a Generation of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Word or <hi>Logos.</hi> To paſs for the preſent the conſideration of thoſe Objections, pretended to have great weight, which are taken from the ſuppos'd Impoſſibility of a change in the Tradition of the Church, as the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Fathers vindicated</hi> argues; I muſt tell him, 'tis in vain for him to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack us with thoſe very Weapons, with which he has already been beaten in <hi>France.</hi> We will make our Defence at the ſame rate he has done his on another occaſion. <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> if you pleaſe, ſhall not be the very Innovator, who changed the Tradition of the Church all at once; 'tis not in that manner Error is equally introduc'd, that's agreed. But you muſt own, whether you will or not, that <hi>Juſtin</hi> was the firſt who brought in the new Mode of expreſſing himſelf in matters of Faith, the firſt who made uſe of a Stile that was ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to his Predeceſſors, <hi>Clemens, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas, Hermas,</hi> and <hi>Polycarp;</hi> and who ſpoke a philoſophic Jargon, wherein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears throout the ſwelling Notions and Expreſſions of <hi>Plato,</hi> and nothing of the Simplicity of J. C. But to what purpoſe was this new Language? unleſs it was to begin the Innovation, under colour of <hi>Embeiliſhing,</hi> of <hi>Accommodation,</hi> and more ample <hi>Explication;</hi> and that this was for prudential Reaſons, and for the purpoſe of the Divine Oeconomy. This is the very way that Error has always taken. The Doctrine of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which eſtabliſh'd it ſelf by force, was indeed made, and introduced all at once by one Man alone: But the Doctrine of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt took time, and came in by degrees; it began with the Impoſture and Fineneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Philoſophy, and us'd no Force nor
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:200403:59"/>Violence, till by its Seducements it had gain'd the upper hand. <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> at firſt imploy'd his Philoſophy in the Cauſe, and Pope <hi>Victor</hi> afterwards his Tyranny: and thus you ſee how the Innovation was compleated; it came in, as the Proverb has it, like a Fox, and reign'd like a Lion.</p>

'Tis not difficult to determine which of theſe two Criticks was in the right. <hi>Pearſon</hi>'s Remark has no other ground but the Stile of <hi>Ignatius</hi> alone, which is the very thing in queſtion: Whereas <hi>Valeſius</hi> his Obſervation is founded upon the conſtant Uſage of the Fathers in the firſt Century, <hi>viz.

                     <p>My laſt Remark is of much greater importance than the two former, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely deciſive in this Controverſy: For in this Paſſage of Bp <hi>Pearſon</hi> you may take notice, that what he affirms will effectually and at once defend all kinds of Unitarian Hereticks, from the formidable Authority of the <hi>Platonizing</hi> Fathers, with which they are always baited. The Fathers who wrote after <hi>Ignatius,</hi> ſays <hi>Pearſon,</hi> the Doctors of the <hi>2d</hi> and <hi>3d</hi> Century, are uſed to borrow their thoughts from the Pagans, and ſometimes to blend 'em with the Chriſtian Religion. Take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that al this is ſaid with regard to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:200403:60"/>Jeſus Chriſt; and remember too that the ſecond Century is the fatal <hi>Epocha,</hi> wherein the Church loſt the Purity and Simplicity of her Principles; which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, as <hi>Hegeſippus</hi> obſerves, ſoon after the Death of the Apoſtles, when <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm</hi> prevail'd. To come to matter of Fact, the Fathers of the firſt and ſecond Century, namely, the <hi>Juſtins,</hi> the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagoraſſes,</hi> the <hi>Theophiluſſes,</hi> the <hi>Irenaeuſſes,</hi> the <hi>Clemens Alexandrinuſſes,</hi> the <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> the <hi>Origens,</hi> &amp;c. theſe Fathers, who wrote after <hi>Ignatius,</hi> have mingled Pagan Notions with the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: therefore thoſe Fathers ought not to be heard in this Controverſy, as good Witneſſes of the Chriſtian Faith; and as to the point of Chriſt's Divinity, ought to be regarded as Demi-Pagans. The <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian Hereticks</hi> likewiſe ought not in reaſon to be attack'd with their Authority: and conſequently the Notion of Chriſt's Divinity ought to be reduc'd to the ſtate and account given of it by the Writers of the firſt Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who were not form'd in the Schools, nor bred up in Libraries, who were not imbu'd with the Sentiments of the <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy</hi> or the <hi>Portico.</hi> In fine, every Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and Expreſſion in their Writings that regards Chriſt's Divinity, and has not the Purity and Simplicity of the firſt Century, cannot be look'd upon as any other but as a ſmatch of <hi>Paganiſm.</hi>

                  <p>TO prove this, that the Theology concerning the Word (or <hi>Logos</hi>) is nothing elſe but a philoſophick No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, partly grounded upon the Divine Power that enter'd and dwelt in the Meſſiah at the moment of his Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there's nothing more to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, than, <hi>1ſt.</hi> That the moſt antient Authors go no further in ſearch after Chriſt's Divinity, than his Birth of a <hi>Virgin. Ignatius,</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> ſatisfies us of this Truth. <q>There is, ſays he, but one Phyſician, who is of Fleſh and of Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten and unbegotten, made a God in the Fleſh, the true Life in Death, born of <hi>Mary</hi> and of God.</q> This Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arguing againſt the <hi>Joſephites,</hi> does not oppoſe to their Error the eternal Generation of the Son of God, but his Birth of a Virgin by the Holy Spirit. I would ſay, he does not ſpeak of a <hi>God incarnate,</hi> but of a Man who was made God in the Fleſh, that is to ſay, who was born a God, or made a God by his Birth, becauſe he was born of God, and of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> In this Senſe <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> aſſures us, that our Phyſician is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fleſh, and partly Spirit; ſince by his wonderful Conception he partook equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the fleſhly [or Human,] and of the Spiritual and Divine Nature. He adds, this <hi>Phyſician is begotten, and unbegotten;</hi> ſince he was begotten of a Woman, like other Men; and at the ſame time unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, having no Man for his Father. Laſtly, he ſays, that this Phyſician was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and of God; which explains all the reſt, for 'tis as much as to ſay, that he was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> by the Power of the Spirit of God, and not by her Intercourſe with <hi>Joſeph:</hi> This word <hi>[God,]</hi> as you may ſee, being there manifeſtly oppos'd to [Man,] or to <hi>[Joſeph.]</hi> 
                     <q>Jeſus Chriſt our God, as <hi>Ignatius</hi> further
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:200403:60"/>ſays in the ſame Epiſtle, was conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> according to the Divine Diſpenſation (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) being in truth of the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> but by the intervention of the Holy Spirit.</q> Where one ſees the ſame Antitheſis continued, which we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in the foregoing Paſſage; that is, between God and <hi>Mary,</hi> and between the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> and the Power of the Spirit. The true Oeconomy, according to <hi>Ignatius,</hi> is not the Incarnation of the Supreme God, but the miraculous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Meſſiah, who is both God and Man, by his Birth of a Woman by the Power of God. This is a Phyſician, who was made God in the Fleſh, being born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and of God; of <hi>David,</hi> and of the Holy Spirit. This is the true Divine Diſpenſation, this is the great Myſtery of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Author, in his Epiſtle to the Church of <hi>Smirna,</hi> preſents us with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paſſage ſutable to this occaſion: For thus he ſpeaks of Jeſus Chriſt, <q>That he was truly of the Race of <hi>David</hi> (or the Son of <hi>David</hi>) according to the Fleſh; but the Son of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Will and Power of God, in that he was truly born of a Virgin.</q> Monſieur <hi>Daillé</hi> having mark'd out this Paſſage of <hi>Ignatius</hi> as Heretical, ſince he makes the Generation of the Son to depend on the Will and Power of the Father; Bp <hi>Pearſon</hi> gives this account of it in his <hi>Vindic. Ignat. Par.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 9. <q>That 'tis clear this Father does not ſpeak of the Eternal Generation of the Son, but of his Incarnation, which, as the World owns, was by the Will and Power of God. For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, adds <hi>Pearſon,</hi> the Interpolator having a mind to pervert theſe Words by applying 'em to the Divine Nature, he was forc'd to change their Order.</q> 'Tis ſufficient, that this Learned Perſon affirms, that in this Paſſage there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of an eternal Generation; and that <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſpeaks not but of Jeſus Chriſt, in alluſion to the Words of the Angel, <hi>The Holy Spirit ſhall come upon thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Wherefore that which,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall be called the Son of God.</hi> 'Tis enough that he owns, this Conception was ſo wonderful, as to intitle Jeſus Chriſt to the Name and Dignity of the Son of God. As for the word [Incarnation,] which <hi>Ignatius</hi> does not uſe, we'll excuſe it in <hi>Pearſon;</hi> 'tis a Term of art unknown to the good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſignifies in the <hi>Platonizing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,</hi> that the Supreme God was made Man. And if it be certain, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> did not ſpeak in this Paſſage but of the miraculous Conception of Jeſus Chriſt, can it be doubted whether he diſcours'd upon that ſame Subject, and by no means on the eternal Generation, in the two other Paſſages I am about to cite, and which are very like to this here? In the mean time Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> has the raſhneſs to produce them for a Proof of that which <hi>he</hi> calls the two Natures of our Saviour, that is, that of a Supreme God, and that of a Man like one of us (in his <hi>Judic. Eccleſ. p.</hi> 5, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>) Who would not wonder at the Artifice of Divines, who have the Skill to pervert theſe Paſſages to ſerve their Notion of the Eternal-Generation? We can furthermore ſhew you the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of this plain antient Divinity in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Fathers who <hi>Platonize</hi> more than <hi>Ignatius,</hi> as in <hi>Juſtin</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> But we ſhall have another opportunity of examining the Theology of thoſe two Fathers; at preſent the Paſſage in <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> will ſuffice, whereby to judg of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>The only Reflection that remains, is, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> having ſo often diſtinguiſh'd between the <hi>Son born of God and of</hi> Mary, and the <hi>Son born of</hi> David <hi>and the Holy Spirit;</hi> 'tis upon this Foundation that the diſtinction of the two Natures in Chriſt, is founded in the true ſenſe of it: or if you pleaſe, his twofold Filia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the one Divine, the other Human. <q>He is the Son of God, ſays the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Queſtions and Anſwers to the Orthodox</hi> (<hi>Queſt.</hi> 66.) in that he
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:200403:61"/>was born of the Holy Spirit; and the Son of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> in that he was born of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Wife.</q> 'Tis in this the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiſts: He was born of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Wife, this is but a <hi>legal Filiation</hi> with regard to <hi>Joſeph;</hi> and he was born of the Spirit of God, this is a proper and <hi>natural Filiation</hi> with reſpect to God. So that in this laſt reſpect, it may be ſaid, that he is truly <hi>Light of Light,</hi> and <hi>God of God.</hi> I have already ſaid it, and I'll repeat it again: The Fathers thought that the Holy Spirit, which overſhadowed the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> in ſome ſort united it ſelf to the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, ſo as never to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from it; and 'tis upon this perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Inhabitation</hi> that they have <hi>philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phized</hi> in their manner, upon the two Natures of our <hi>Saviour. Grotius</hi> aim'd at this Theology in one of his Notes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.19. <q>The <hi>Plenitude</hi> of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Vertues, ſays he, dwelt in Jeſus Chriſt; that is to ſay, 'twas perpetually and inſeparably united, and not by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals, as in the Prophets.</q> This is what's called the <hi>Hypoſtatick <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion:</hi> This in effect, is the perſonal Union of the Divine with the Human Nature, even this <hi>Shekinah,</hi> or this perpetual Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Spirit of God in Jeſus Chriſt. To go farther in queſt of other Myſteries, betrays a Vanity of Mind. The Fathers compriz'd all in what I have ſaid, and upon it they built thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Speculations with which their Books are fill'd. If at ſome times they went farther, and ſpoke of the <hi>Word</hi> in a manner not agreeable with the ground I have laid down, 'tis becauſe they have ſuffer'd themſelves to be ſurpriz'd, and their eyes to be dazled with cheir <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> Philoſophy. The <hi>Wonderful</hi> and the <hi>Sublime</hi> are very tempting Schemes. Theſe <hi>Platoniſts</hi> are a ſort of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, or rather of Divines, who have made a Voyage to the <hi>World of Ideas;</hi> and ſome Chriſtians are ſo weak as to ſwallow all their Viſions for Myſteries. But let us always remember, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Fathers, that how far ſoever they wander'd in their large Field of <hi>Platonick</hi> Contemplation, they never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd ſo far as to equal the Divinity of the <hi>Word</hi> with that of his Father. <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> who is one of them that went far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt, never carried his Theology to that extreme. Whatever lofty Idea he had of the Son, he declares however, in his <hi>14th</hi> Tome on St. <hi>John,</hi> 
                     <q>That the Son was ſo much below the Father, as he and the Holy Spirit were above the moſt noble Creatures.</q> Go we now after this, and ſay, that the Fathers held the neceſſity of believing that the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God was incarnate, and that Jeſus Chriſt is that Supreme God.

                  <p>WE have no more to do, but to conſider the antient Creeds, and to compare thoſe which were form'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Apoſtolick Theology,</hi> with ſuch as were fram'd according to the <hi>Platenick Scheme;</hi> and we ſhall find in theſe latter, that the Article of the <hi>Generation</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> and of his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> came in the room of that of the <hi>Conception</hi> of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> which is found in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:200403:61"/>Creeds. <q>The univerſal Church, ſays <hi>Irenaeus</hi> (<hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.) hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this Faith from the Holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, which is, <hi>to believe in one God the Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and in Jeſus Chriſt his only Son, incarnate for our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c.</q> There's nothing in this Confeſſion of the Faith of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, which is not in the very Creed of the Apoſtles, excepting the word <hi>[Incarnate:]</hi> But 'tis clear that it ſtands in the very place of thoſe other words, [<hi>conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, born of the Virgin</hi> Mary,] which are wanting in this Creed of <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> He would ſay, that the Spirit of God united it ſelf to real, and not to celeſtial and aerial Fleſh, as ſome Hereticks imagin'd. The turn is ſomewhat <hi>Platonizing;</hi> but after all, he did not intend to advance any thing but the antient Doctrine, ſince he diſputes againſt thoſe men, who held that Jeſus Chriſt was pure Spirit clothed with ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Fleſh: and he on the other hand, ſuppoſed that Jeſus Chriſt was a real Man, true Fleſh animated with a Divine Spirit, a Man born of a Virgin, truly born of the Subſtance of a Woman, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho form'd by the Power of a Spirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in one of his Tracts <hi>(de ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Virg. in initio)</hi> having given us this plain Rule of Faith; which he calls the immutable and unchangeable Rule, to this purpoſe, <q>
                        <hi>That we muſt believe in one God alone,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and in his Son Jeſus Chriſt born of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> in another Tract <hi>(de Praeſcrip. adv. Haereſ.)</hi> preſents you with another Rule of the <hi>Platonizing</hi> Faith, which is, <q>to believe that the ſame Word, by which God created the World, ſpoke to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, and inſpir'd the Prophets, coming forth from the Spirit, and the Power of the Father, it lit upon the Virgin, and was made Fleſh, and wrought in J.C. all ſorts of Miracles.</q> Had he forgot that the Apoſtolick Faith is not to be changed or reformed? No without doubt, he does not pretend to change any thing, but only gives the antient Opinion of the Conception of J. C. in <hi>Platonick Stile,</hi> in <hi>Philoſophick Jargon:</hi> or to ſpeak better, he ſubſtitutes an Allegory manag'd with force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the room of this Evangelical Expreſſion <hi>[born of a Virgin by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt,]</hi> which is plain and literal. This Spirit, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſays, being an Emanation from the Spirit, and the Power of the Father, may be ſaid in a myſtick and ſublime Senſe, to be the ſame Spirit who created the World, and inſpir'd the Prophets.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> in his <hi>Catecheſes,</hi> explains a Creed purely <hi>Arian,</hi> which Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be the antient Creed of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> the Mother of all Churches. <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> it ſays, <hi>in One God the Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and in One Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the only Son of God, begotten of the Father before Ages, true God, by whom all things were made, incarnate and made Man,</hi> &amp;c. I ſaid, this Creed is <hi>Arian,</hi> for 'tis expreſſed in the ſame Terms as all the <hi>Arian Confeſſions</hi> that are now extant. And if the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor pretends, that 'tis Orthodox at the beſt hand, it can paſs for no more than the <hi>Creed of Conſtantinople,</hi> as Monfieur <hi>Le Vaſſor</hi> has obſerved, (<hi>Traité de <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

If it be true, that the <hi>Catecheſes</hi> we have, are thoſe which <hi>Cyril</hi> made in his Youth, as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> reports it; this Prelate reviewed and augmented 'em, after the Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whoſe Creed he explains almoſt word for word. In this caſe, it will not be certain, that the Article concerning the Church was in the Creed of <hi>Jeruſalem. Cyril</hi> might have added it to his <hi>Catecheſes</hi> after the Synod.</q> If this Conjecture holds as to the Article of the Church, much more will it do ſo as to the <hi>Platonick Word.</hi> We can but ſay, in this caſe, it will not be certain, that the Article con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>a Son begotten before Ages,</hi> was in

                  </p>
                  <p>Let's join with this Learned Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte, the famous Monſ. <hi>du Pin,</hi> who in his ſecond <hi>Tom.</hi> of his <hi>Bibliotheque, p.</hi> 413. inunuates <q>the Novelty of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril</hi>'s Creed upon this account: 1. That it has the Article of <hi>Life Everlaſting,</hi> which is not in all the antient Creeds. And in his 1 <hi>Tom. Paris Edit. p.</hi> 30. he ſays, that <hi>Cyril</hi> in his <hi>Catecheſes</hi> makes a particular Creed, which the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> us'd at the time that this Father wrote his <hi>Catecheſes.</hi> That thoſe who have made Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries upon the Creed, have omitted among others theſe Words [Life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting.] And that St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in his Letter to <hi>Pammachius,</hi> that the Creed ended with theſe Words <hi>[The Reſurrection of the Fleſh.]</hi>
                     </q> Theſe Words of <hi>du Pin</hi> are remarkable. He ſays, <hi>Cyril</hi> made a Creed which was peculiar to him, and that it cannot be aſcribed to the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> till the time when this Father wrote. For 'tis certain, that this is the ſenſe of their Words, in an Author that profeſſes to believe that the Creed is not antient.</p>
                  <p>But however that be, Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives himſelf groſly, in ſuppoſing this Creed of <hi>Cyril</hi> to be the antient Creed of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> We can produce another of greater Antiquity, which the ſame Church aſcribes to the Apoſtle St. <hi>James.</hi> Biſhop <hi>

Thus 'tis read in the antient Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to St. <hi>James,</hi> who is held to have been the firſt Biſhop of that Place: and with this Creed an <hi>Office</hi> was read once a year, in memory of its Antiquity. And ſince the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that follow have (which I mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regret) been left out, as ſuppos'd to be generally known; I thought it proper to repair this Loſs; by ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting in the room of what is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the entire Confeſſion of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolic Faith, that <hi>Cyril</hi> expounded to the Illuminated at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which indeed is ſomewhat larger, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by this addition at the beginning [<hi>viz.</hi> viſible and inviſible.]</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſhort Creed which <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> gives us being made by St. <hi>James,</hi> it follows, that of <hi>Cyril</hi> is an Expoſition and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary: And 'tis impoſſible on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that this ſhould be an Abridgment of <hi>Cyril</hi>'s Creed; for nothing can be more antient than the draught of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle. Without doubt, the <hi>ſhorter Creed is the Original,</hi> and the larger none other than a Copy ſtuffed and lengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a <hi>wretched Platoniſm,</hi> and has not Simplicity enough to paſs for an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's; but it may, without wrong, be accounted the Work of a Platonizing Faction. But let that be as it will, there is good ground for believing, that Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> had a mind to deceive us, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling his Knowledg of this antient <hi>Creed</hi> of St. <hi>James,</hi> of which Biſhop <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> makes mention; and in palming upon us for the moſt antient <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Creed, that of S. <hi>Cyril</hi> which is ſo very different. For altho we have but two Articles of the <hi>Jeruſalem Creed,</hi> which is the ſame with what we call the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> yet theſe two are ſufficient to ſhew, that the <hi>Apoſtles Creed</hi> is in effect the moſt antient of all; however Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> (<hi>Jud. Eccleſ. p.</hi> 128.) pretends it to have been of later Date: And I ſay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, this may ſatisfy us, that at this time [of <hi>Cyril</hi>] the Mother of all Churches had ſtrangely alter'd her Faith.</p>

He might have obſerved the ſame, and the thing is obvious, that the ſecond Article, concerning the Perſon of J.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> has compar'd the ſhorter of theſe two Oriental Creeds with the <hi>Roman:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ſhorter Creed was not the ſame with the <hi>Roman,</hi> let the Doctor ſay what he will; nor are we to be much concern'd, as the Primate ſpeaks, for the Loſs of it<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </q> Note here all the difference the <hi>Eaſterns</hi> made between their Creed, and that we call the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: There's nothing in 'em of the Pre-exiſtence of J. C. and his Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before Ages, as you have it in <hi>Cyril</hi>'s Creed. This ſhews that the Article con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning J.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> gives us; that the <hi>[etc.]</hi> does not retrench any part of it, but is plac'd at the end of the Article, only to ſhew that the remaining Articles are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. We may conclude therefore, that all the Jargon of the <hi>Platovic</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy in <hi>Cycil</hi>'s Greed, took place of the antient ſimple Tradition [which was] <hi>I believe in J. C. the only Son of God, who was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, born of the Virgin</hi> Mary. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the antient Opinion of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and Deification of J. C. ran no higher than his being born of a Virgin by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt; this was the true Theology concerning him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ruffinus</hi> had reaſon for calling this plain Confeſſion, the Tradition of his Anceſtors, meaning thereby, not the Doctors bigotted with <hi>Plato</hi>'s Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm, but the whole Body of the Church (the People, as <hi>Du Pin</hi> obſerves, <hi>Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 30.) who doubtleſs never enter'd into the Speculations of thoſe Doctors. Let us ſee what <hi>Marcellus</hi> wrote to Pope <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> (<hi>Epiphan. haereſ.</hi> 72.) where (after he had ſaid what he thought fit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Word, which he denies to be an Hypoſtaſis diſtinct from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaying it ſubſiſts in the Father, and that 'tis his very Wiſdom and his inſeparable Power) he confines himſelf to this Confeſſion of Faith, which he ſays, he had received from the Scripture and his Anceſtors: <q>
                        <hi>I believe in God Almighty, and in J. C. his only Son our Lord, begotten by the Holy Ghoſt of the Virgin</hi> Mary, who was crucified under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and was <hi>buried, the third day be was raiſed from the Dead and aſcended into Heaven, and ſat at the right hand, of God. Whence</hi> he ſhall come to judg the Quick and the Dead. And [I believe] <hi>in the Holy Ghoſt, the Holy Church, the Remiſſion of Sins, the Reſurrection of the Fleſh, the Life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting.</hi>
                     </q> See here in expreſs words the Creed we call the Apoſtles, the <hi>antient Theology,</hi> without Platoniſm, without Speoulation. There's nothing retrench'd from the antient Confeſſions of Faith, yet Retrenchments were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual amongſt ſome of them. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome Creeds are found to be larger in ſome of the Antients, 'tis according to their laudable Practice, by an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their novel Interpretations. This is the more evident, becauſe that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Interpretations are found to be pure <hi>Platoniſm,</hi> with which 'tis known they were extremely bigotted.</p>

                  <p>TO render the Antiquity of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Creed doubtful, 'tis ſaid, that 'tis notorious, that the greater part of the Articles have been added from time to time, and upon divers occaſions. What of that, if thoſe additional Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are not in the preſent Conteſt? Is it not enough, that the three Articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as to their Nature and Perſon (as we ſpeak) I ſay thoſe three Articles, whereupon we diſpute, are very antient? 'Tis true, the antient Formulas of Faith contain'd ſcarce any thing beſides theſe, which are an Expoſition of the Form of Baptiſm; but then 'tis of theſe only we are debating. Yea the Liturgy aſcribed to St. <hi>James,</hi> and the Oriental Creed of <hi>Ruſſinus,</hi> give us theſe Articles in the proper Words of Scripture, clean of all <hi>Platoniſm.</hi> Is not ſuch a piece of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity more primitive, and even antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to <hi>Cyril</hi> and all the <hi>Platonic Fathers?</hi> But this Creed, ſays Dr. <hi>Bull,</hi> whatever Simplicity it has, is to be underſtood in the Extent or Latitude the <hi>Platonizing Fathers</hi> took it in, who made it; always ſuppoſing, as you ſee, that it was not made, till ſince the Church expounded in her larger Creeds her <hi>Platonic</hi> Faith. I will turn this manner of reaſoning upon him, and ſay, that ſuppoſing on the contrary, the antient Liturgy had this Creed in the Simplicity, wherein we have it at this time; it cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood but in the ſenſe of the <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene</hi> Diſciples of St. <hi>James,</hi> who moſt certainly did not <hi>platonize,</hi> as indeed we have prov'd. <hi>Platoniſm</hi> owes not its Riſe to the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> but to the <hi>Gentile Converts,</hi> and ſuch Gentiles too as were Followers of <hi>Plato.</hi> True Orthodoxy at the very beginning of Chriſtianity, conſiſted in believing that J. C. <hi>was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was of a celeſtial Race or Origin: That he had a ſort of Pre-exiſtence in this H. Spirit of Power, which was united to him, and that upon theſe accounts, he was really and in the Letter, the proper, and only Son of God. A Doctrine, which the Diſciples of St. <hi>James</hi> maintained againſt the <hi>Cerinthians</hi> and <hi>Ebionites;</hi> there being no other Controverſy than concerning the Generation of the Son of God. For which reaſon the Creed of <hi>Marcellus</hi> ſays barely, that the only Son of God <hi>was begotten by the Holy Ghoſt of a Virgin, and not begotten before Ages;</hi> which might have been ſaid with as much eaſe as t'other, and muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have been ſaid, if the meaning of the Author of the Creed had been, that [only Son] ſignifies, <hi>begotten from all Eternity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But after all, what will the Doctor ſay with his Interpretations and his Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the antient Creed? I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in divers Paſſages of his Writings, that he requires too much to be granted him. For inſtance, he will have it in his <hi>Judic. Eccleſ. p.</hi> 141. that this Elogy of the Holy Ghoſt in the Creed of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, The Living Lord, proceeding from the Father, who is to be worſhiped and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with the Father and the Son;</hi> That this magnificent Elogy was an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Word [Paraclet] in the Creed of <hi>Cyril.</hi> Wonderful Paraphraſe, ſtrange Interpretation: that the Paraclet
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:200403:63"/>ſhould ſignify all theſe fine things! <hi>The Living Lord! proceeding from the Father! who is to be worſhipped and glorified with the Father and the Son.</hi> Well! after this do we think the Doctor does not deſire to be believed, when he aſſures us, that <hi>the Son begotten before Ages, the true God by whom all things were made,</hi> is the true ſenſe of theſe Words, <hi>the only Son of God?</hi> With the good Leave of this Commentary-Maker, 'tis more natural to believe, in adhering to the Terms of the antient Creed, that begotten by the Holy Ghoſt of a Virgin, is the true Senſe and the right Expoſition.</p>
                  <p>In fine, this pure, ſimple Creed, was not fram'd by a <hi>Cabal,</hi> a Party; as the Creeds of the Councils of <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> were, &amp;c. 'Tis not known, if I may ſo ſpeak, whence it came; 'tis as it were fallen down from Heaven, 'tis the Suffrage of the Univerſal Church, and 'tis this Suffrage that has ſaved the Church from Shipwrack, and gain'd her Reverence. <hi>Ruffinus</hi> in his <hi>Expoſ.

Says he, <q>This Creed is the very Badge and Livery of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, the <hi>Abridgment</hi> of that Faith, which was received from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: for altho in their Epiſtles, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to ſuch as were already Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, one finds no one complete Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of theſe Articles, which they taught every where, becauſe they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd them ſufficiently known; yet however the moſt antient Writers of the Church aſſure us, that in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where the Apoſtles went to plant the Faith (of Chriſt) they publiſh'd there diſtinctly, and left there all theſe Articles, which ſerve for a Foundation to the Chriſtian Life. And 'tis reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to believe, that the Apoſtles Creed was the ſummary of theſe f<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Articles.—'Tis certain, that before the <hi>Nicene Creed</hi> was made, all the Churches in the World us'd this formulary of Faith, which they received from their Anceſtors, and they from the Apoſtles themſelves (<hi>See Irenaeus lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2. &amp; <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 4.) and there is not the leaſt room to doubt, but this is the very ſame with that we at this day call the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Creed.—<hi>Marcellus</hi> gives us a Confeſſion of his Faith, which he ſays he received from his Predeceſſors, which is found to be the ſame with our Apoſtles Creed (<hi>See Epiphan.

Donat. cap.</hi> 24. viz. that 'tis reaſonable to believe, that what has generally been received in the Church, and has always been held by it, <hi>without being inſtituted by any Council,</hi> comes to us from Apoſtolic Tradition (alſo.)</q> 
                     <hi>Tertullian de veland. Virg.</hi> 
                     <q>The Rule of Faith, ſays he, is one and immutable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> That this Abridgment of our Creed given us by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> is <hi>one</hi> and <hi>immutable,</hi> can be from no other Cauſe but from its Apoſtolic Origin, which alone ought to pretend to that Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege. For this reaſon the ſame Father ſays elſewhere (<hi>contr. Prax. cap.</hi> 2.) <hi>This Rule came down to us from the very firſt preaching of the Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true, the Controverſy that the Platonizing Chriſtians had at firſt with the Chriſtians of <hi>Judea,</hi> made the Church, when in power, deſpiſe this Creed, which favour'd its Adverſaries; ſo that it but rarely appears in its Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, but is for the moſt part clog'd and blended with <hi>Platoniſm.</hi> But in the fourth Century, the Diſpute being only between the <hi>Athanaſians</hi> and the <hi>Arians,</hi> both good <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> holding the Pre-exiſtence; this Creed was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for it oppos'd one no more than
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:200403:64"/>t'other; and neither of theſe two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties had then prevailed over one another. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> made it always her Creed, for the <hi>Platonic</hi> Controverſies were not ſo warm there as in the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> But Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> will return to the Charge, and tell us, as he has done more than once, that <hi>to be begotten by the Holy Ghoſt of a Virgin,</hi> is no ſuch glorious Privilege for the Meſſias; that it does not give him any Preheminence above ſome other Men, who have been miraculouſly begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and by the immediate Power of God: That in a word, it anſwers not that great Idea, which thoſe Words (the only Son of God) naturally raiſe in our Minds. I have already anſwered this Objection, with a Paſſage of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew</hi> of <hi>Edeſſa.</hi> I could further ſay, that according to this way of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning of the Doctor's, J.C. is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by his Hypotheſis the only Son of God, if we take thoſe Words, as he does, in their ſtricteſt ſenſe, becauſe he has a Brother begotten of God as well as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I mean the Holy Ghoſt. He will clear himſelf of this, when he can ſhew me what the difference is between <hi>Generation</hi> and <hi>Proceſſion,</hi> that is to ſay between <hi>Emanation</hi> and <hi>Emanation.</hi> I mean ſuch a difference, that makes the one a Son, and the other not; this is what we expect from him.</p>
                  <p>He knows very well, that this knotty difficulty put St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hard to it. This Father in his <hi>5th Book,</hi> 9. <hi>ch. de Trin.</hi> puts this Queſtion: <q>Whence is it that the third Perſon is not the Image of God as well as the ſecond? Why not his Word? Why not his begotten Son? He proteſts that 'tis hard to give a reaſon, why the Father did not beget one as well as t'other, ſince as the <hi>Intellect</hi> begat its <hi>Wiſdom</hi> by knowing it ſelf, it ſeems likely it ſhould beget its <hi>Love,</hi> by loving it ſelf.</q> And at laſt finding himſelf too weak to maſter this difficulty, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himſelf to his uſual Sophiſtry, and makes you a rare <hi>Medley</hi> of Diſcourſe, wherein he underſtands not what he ſays himſelf. After ſo great a Maſter, what may we expect from Dr. <hi>Bull?</hi> or rather who will not be ſurprized to hear his Objections? <hi>'Tis not enough,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that God begets a Son of the Subſtance of a Woman, by his own Power, without the Intervention of a Man: 'Tis not enough that this Generation is without Example. This extraordinary Son, if</hi> he be not the Supreme God, <hi>he is not therefore the Son of God. 'Tis not enough that God has given us an extraordinary Man for the Meſſias. If he be not the Supreme God, he cannot be the Meſſias.</hi> Wonderful! What! if God had thought fit to ſend none other than ſuch a Man, a ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> not a jot more the Son of God than the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was, ſhall this be no <hi>Meſſias?</hi> And would this be done upon a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Religion? Should this Meſſias be thought unworthy of us, becauſe he does not anſwer the Idea, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the Doctor? <hi>I am aſtoniſh'd, when I conſider the extravagant Hypotheſis of our Trinitarians.</hi> God (in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) will not make good his illuſtrious Promiſes, his Word given to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, and his Oath ſworn to <hi>David,</hi> that he would raiſe him up a Son to reign upon his Throne: God, I ſay, will do nothing that will anſwer the Greatneſs of his Promiſe, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> if the <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Seed,</hi> if the King ſo often promis'd and ſo long expected, if the Meſſias, who is ſo glorious, be not the ſupreme God himſelf. Nothing is magnificent, according to theſe Gentlemen, if it be not extravagant. God may <hi>do well</hi> in raiſing a miraculous Seed to <hi>Abraham</hi> from the Womb of a Virgin: And he may <hi>do well</hi> in raiſing up to <hi>David</hi> a King and a Prophet, drench'd with the Fulneſs of his Spirit, and reigning at the Right Hand of his Majeſty. All this has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing great in it, this will not come up to their Syſtem of the Meſſias, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve place in their ſublime Theology, if the ſupreme God himſelf be not incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:200403:64"/>and ſuffers not himſelf to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, to merit by his Sufferings the ſame Glory he voluntarily abandon'd. This is what they call a glorious Goſpel, not that plain ſimple Religion, which preſents you with a Man aſcending into Heaven; but that which without, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines</hi> or <hi>Hocus Pocus,</hi> brings the ſupreme God down from Heaven. Good God! What vain Imaginations are in the Heart of Man!</p>

                  <p>IT is time to conſider in the third place, that the Theology of the Primitive Church went no farther than the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Conception of the Meſſias: Which appears from this, that the Expreſſion <hi>[mere Man]</hi> which ſhe condemned as heretical, was not oppos'd to an <hi>Eternal Generation,</hi> but to Chriſt's being begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Holy Ghoſt of a Virgin. So that the Platonizing Chriſtians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who have us'd it in this laſt ſenſe, have been as it were forced to do it thro Cuſtom: What remains of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Tradition, obliging them to ſpeak in that manner.

                     </gap>] bear at this day in our Minds a different Idea from that which was in the firſt Ages of the Church. With us now, it is ſuppoſed to exclude I know not what ſort of a <hi>Generation of the Subſtance of God:</hi> But with the Antients it was purely oppos'd to the miraculous <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Subſtance of a Virgin.</hi> We find at this day ſome Footſteps of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient uſage of theſe Words. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Apoſtolic Conſtitutions, <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 26. giving an account of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the <hi>Ebionites,</hi> ſays, <hi>They hold J. C. to have been a [mere Man] by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that he was not begotten any other way, but by the conjugal Intercourſe of</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph <hi>and</hi> Mary. There cannot be a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter account than this, of what the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents meant by a <hi>mere Man:</hi> A Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and not a Man, who is not the ſupreme God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Juſtin,</hi> or the Author of the Queſtions and Anſwers to the Orthodox, <hi>Quaeſt.</hi> 66. expreſſes himſelf thus: <q>Who (ſays he, ſpeaking of J. C.) was begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten or conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, the Son of God, but being born of the Wife of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> was the Son of <hi>Joſeph. The Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Wherefore,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Son of God.</hi>
                     </q> It muſt be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved here: 1. That Son of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and Son of God, are two Terms oppos'd. J.C. is called the Son of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> as he was born of the Wife of <hi>Joſeph;</hi> and the Son of God, as he was begotten by the Holy Ghoſt. 2. That J. C. is called <hi>[Son of God]</hi> on the account of his being begotten by the Holy Ghoſt, in a ſenſe directly oppoſed to <hi>[Son of Man]</hi> that is to ſay, in a ſenſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, which Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> is ſo bold as to deny. 3. That the Text of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> which <hi>Juſtin</hi> cites as a Proof, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates in ſome ſort, that the Antients did not at firſt aſcribe any other Divinity to J. C. but that which was grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his being conceived, and born of a Virgin by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>In the next place let's attend to <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> who takes the Terms <hi>[mere Man]</hi> in the ſame ſenſe as <hi>Juſtin:</hi> 
                     <q>They
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:200403:65"/>ſays he, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 23. who call him (<hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt) a mere Man begotten by <hi>Joſeph,</hi> continue in the Bondage of the antient Diſobedience.</q> They then, according to <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> held J. C. to be a <hi>mere Man,</hi> who believed <hi>he was begotten by</hi> Joſeph, and conſequently not begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Holy Ghoſt of a Virgin: To make good this Charge againſt thoſe Perſons, it was not it ſeems neceſſary they ſhould have denied a <hi>Platonic Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> But the Paſſage is ſo clear it needs no gloſs.</p>
                  <p>I proceed to another Father, and that is <hi>Euſeb.</hi> in his 3. <hi>B. c.</hi> 27. where he ſpeaks thus of the <hi>Ebionites:</hi> 
                     <q>They believe J. C. to be a <hi>mere Man,</hi> an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Perſon begotten by <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> but otherwiſe a juſt Man, and extraordinary for his Vertue.</q> You ſee how <hi>Euſebius,</hi> when <hi>Platoniſm</hi> did not run in his Head, acquaints us, that they were none other than <hi>Ebionites,</hi> who held J. C. was begotten by <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary;</hi> upon which account it may be truly ſaid, that they made him a mere ordinary Man. This ſcap'd <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> without doubt, by his following the Mode of ſpeaking according to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Tradition, which oppoſed in the Hereticks of that time, not thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians who denied an eternal Generation of the Subſtance of God, for where was that Notion then? but the <hi>Ebionites,</hi> who conteſted the miraculous Generation of the Subſtance of a Virgin.</p>
                  <p>It remains that I examine two Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of <hi>Epiphanius:</hi> The <hi>1ſt</hi> is in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the 29th Hereſy, which is that of the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> whom he ranks among the Hereticks; altho <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who muſt have known them better, has made no mention of this pretended Hereſy: <q>I do not affirm, ſays <hi>Epiphanius</hi> of thoſe <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> whether, following the Impiety of <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> they received J. C. to be but a mere Man; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they acknowledged, which is the Truth, that he was begotten by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt on the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary.</hi>
                     </q> The two things oppos'd in this Paſſage, make it evident to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> that it is not believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing J. C. to be a <hi>mere Man,</hi> when with <hi>Socinus</hi> 'tis own'd, that he was begotten by the Holy Ghoſt of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond Paſſage of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> is in his <hi>54th</hi> Hereſy, which is that called the <hi>Theodotians,</hi> who he tells you, held J. C. to be a <hi>mere Man.</hi> How ſo? Why be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believed he was begotten by a Man. This is clear, one Propoſition explains t'other; to be a mere Man, and to be begotten by a Man, are Phraſes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent. And by the Rule of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>to be begotten by the Holy Ghoſt, is to be more than a mere Man,</hi> that is, to be the Son of God. The Angel tells us as much, and without doubt theſe were the Words which were the Foundation of the Theology of the Antients: For, ſays the Angel, <hi>The Power of the Higheſt ſhall overſhaddow thee, and that which ſhall be born of thee,</hi> not that which was begotten from Eternity, but <hi>that which ſhall be born of thee,</hi> ſhall be called the Son of God. The Angel alludes to the Spirit of God, which overſhadowed the <hi>Chaos;</hi> as if he would ſay, that the ſame Power of God, which drew the World out of that unſhapen Maſs, would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe cauſe the Meſſias to be born of <hi>Matter</hi> as infertile as the Chaos it ſelf, even of the Womb of a Virgin; and that becauſe of this extraordinary Birth, he ſhould be called the Son of God <hi>(See Maldonate in Loc.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Expreſſions of the Angel have that force in them, that the Moderns themſelves, when they are free from Prejudice, and their Minds are not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the Controverſy, have made them their Rule, according to which they expreſs themſelves as to the Filiation of J. C. often alledging his Conception of the Holy Ghoſt, as the formal Reaſon that made him the Son of God, in oppoſition to <hi>Son of Man.</hi> Thus Biſhop <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſber</hi> us'd them, in explaining a Paſſage of <hi>Ignatius</hi> (<hi>Diſſertat. in Ignat. cap.</hi> 12.) where he
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:200403:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſays, <q>The Devil knew not whether the Mother of our Saviour, who was married to a Man, was a Virgin at the Birth of the Child, nor whether the new-born Infant ought to be called the Son of God, or the Son of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph.</hi>
                     </q> This Learned Perſon explaining an Apoſtolic Doctrine, ſpeaks in an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolic Manner: He oppoſes [<hi>Son of</hi> Joſeph] to <hi>[Son of God]</hi> but to what Son of God? To a Son begotten from all Eternity? 'Tis plain enough of what Son he is ſpeaking, 'tis to a Son of God who was begotten by the Holy Ghoſt, who was not the Son of any Man, altho he was born of a Woman; and who had none but God for his Father. So <hi>Grotius</hi> upon <hi>Mark</hi> 1.1. having given the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why St. <hi>Mark</hi> ſpoke nothing of the miraculous Birth of J. C. he adds: <q>That 'twas not neceſſary to ſpeak of it till there were ſuch, who held that J. C. was no more than a <hi>mere Man.</hi>
                     </q> From which Words of this <hi>great Critic</hi> it follows, that to hold J. C. to be a mere Man, is not to deny him to be the ſupreme God, but to deny that he was born of a Virgin.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> in his <hi>Judicium Eccleſ. p.</hi> 43. objects againſt this antient Faith, that no Writer has ſpoken of it, as of a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion different from the <hi>Platonic</hi> Faith, which is pretended to have prevailed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. That on the contrary, <hi>Euſebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> gives this Teſtimony of the Biſhops of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that they had a right Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of J. C. and that their Doctrine was ſound on this Article. But that which I am now going to ſay concerning this antient Faith, and that which ſhall be ſaid hereafter, makes it evident e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that 'tis to little purpoſe for the Doctor to boaſt, that Antiquity is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſilent in this matter. As for his Proof from <hi>Euſebius,</hi> 'tis too uncertain and general to be us'd as an Argument in our Queſtion. <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſays in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that the Antients were ſound in their Opinion, or had a right Knowledg of J. C. Who doubts it? Since in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving him to be born of a Virgin by the Operation of the Holy Ghoſt, and not by her Converſation with <hi>Joſeph,</hi> they profeſſed the ſound Doctrine of that time; and they rejected the Error op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to it, which made J. C. but a <hi>mere Man.</hi> But <hi>Euſebius,</hi> 'twill be ſaid, could not ſpeak ſo, but with regard to his own Opinion, which was that of the Pre-exiſtence. But I ſhall reply, whence had <hi>Euſebius</hi> his Information, that the Doctrine of the Antients was ſound? Was it not from <hi>Hegeſippus?</hi> or, as he himſelf ſays, from Monuments of the Antients, which is the ſame thing. But if this antient Author <hi>(Hegeſippus)</hi> did not believe the <hi>Platonic</hi> Pre-exiſtence, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> did; will it not follow, that the Doctrine of theſe Biſhops was ſound, not with reſpect to the ſenſe of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> but with regard to the antient Author, who gives them that Teſtimony? Every one frames for himſelf an Idea of ſound Doctrine, according to his particular Judgment of things. Suppoſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that this antient Author believed, as the Orthodox Doctrine of his time was, that J. C. was not the Son of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary;</hi> and (ſuppoſing) on the other ſide, there was none other Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of his Birth than this, that he was the Son of God by the Virgin <hi>Mary; Hegeſippus</hi> might very well ſay, the <hi>Nazarene</hi> Biſhops were ſound in their Doctrine of the Perſon of J. C. without any ground for concluding thence, that they held the <hi>Platonic Faith,</hi> and were of <hi>Euſebius</hi> his Judgment. 'Tis enough that they were not engaged in the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the <hi>Ebionites,</hi> becauſe they were Orthodox. To explain this by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, let's ſuppoſe that <hi>Euſebius</hi> had ſaid of ſome <hi>Arian</hi> Eiſhop, that his Faith was ſound as to the Perſon of J.C. could the Doctor and his Friends thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that this Biſhop believed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiality and Equality of the Father and the Son? By no means. All they could hence infer, is, that the Biſhop be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the <hi>Platonic</hi> Pre-exiſtence, which
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:200403:66"/>was the true Faith according to <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who believed neither the <hi>Conſubſtantiality</hi> nor the <hi>Equality,</hi> &amp;c. We ought to reaſon in the ſame manner from the Words of <hi>Heg<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſippus,</hi> who held that for a ſound Faith, which <hi>Euſebius</hi> would have called impious, if he had known it, as the Doctor would that which <hi>Euſebius</hi> thought ſound. Who does not know, that thoſe very Perſons, who held the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Faith of the firſt Ages, I mean that of the miraculous Birth of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, were accounted impious in the time of <hi>Euſebius?</hi> Becauſe they would not receive the Notion of the <hi>Platonic Word,</hi> and the modiſh Philoſophy of an Eternal Generation, that was raſhly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinduced or brought in the room of a plain Doctrine, of a Generation in time of <hi>Mary</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt, that is of a Woman, by (the Power of) God. But from the beginning it was not ſo, they had another Theology, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Demonſtration of which, I ſhall ſhew in the following Chapter that,</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> The Word, and the Holy Spirit (or Holy Ghoſt) according to the ſenſe of the Antients, were but one and the ſame thing.</head>
                  <p>I Shall laſtly conſider that the [Word] among the Antients, and the [Holy Ghoſt] in the Evangeliſts, are but one and the ſame thing; and that the Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing Writers themſelves, led by an antient Tradition, the Footſteps whereof remain'd a long time, have confounded theſe two Terms, having often uſed 'em in one and the ſame Signification: An evident Proof that the Philoſophy of the <hi>Platonic Word</hi> owes its Birth to <hi>Allegories</hi> made upon that <hi>Divine Power,</hi> which overſhadowed the Bleſſed Virgin; which Power may be indifferently call'd the Holy Ghoſt, or the Word. But as the latter Term is more agreeable to the Doctrine of <hi>Plato,</hi> ſo 'tis more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed. So that at laſt, this Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Terms brought the <hi>Platonic</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to a conformity in Doctrine with <hi>Plato;</hi> that is to ſay, they fell into two Errors directly oppoſite to the Doctrine of the Goſpel. One, in that they have made of a Power, or a mere Operation, an <hi>Hypoſtaſis;</hi> the other, in that they have made two Hypoſtaſes, of the Word and the Holy Ghoſt, which at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom are but two diverſe Operations. Where therefore they made two Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſes of theſe two Operations, they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd their own Philoſophy; but when they confounded theſe [Operations] they built, without queſtion, upon this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of <hi>David,</hi> which ſays, <hi>The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens were made by the Word of the Lord, and by the Breath of his Mouth;</hi> where the Word and Breath of the Lord are put together as things inſeparable, which differ not in effect, only in this, that the <hi>Breath</hi> is the Subſtance of the <hi>Word,</hi> and the Word is the Operation of the Spirit, to uſe the Words of <hi>Tertullian, adv. Prax.</hi>

                  <p>I ſhall paſs over <hi>Hermas,</hi> who in his <hi>5th</hi> &amp; <hi>9th Similitudes,</hi> ſays, <hi>That the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt is the Son of God.</hi> I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewn that he ſpeaks thus but in parable; for which reaſon his Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would be of no uſe but to ſerve for an Illuſion. And I ſhall ſay nothing more of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who ſalutes the Church at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> in the Inſcription of his Epiſtle, with theſe Words, <hi>The Holy Spirit which is the Word of God;</hi> as if he had ſaid, by or thro him, who is the Holy Ghoſt, or the Word of God. This
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:200403:66"/>Paſſage is not very exact or clear, ſo as to perceive the meaning of the Author, and to be able to draw from it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Proof. Les us begin therefore with <hi>Juſtin Martyr.</hi> He in his <hi>2d Apol. p.</hi> 74, &amp;c. having ſtil'd Jeſus Chriſt the <q>firſt and principal Power, the <hi>Son</hi> and the <hi>Word,</hi> who had not his Birth from Man,</q> but by the Power of God; he comes afterwards to examine the Paſſage in St. <hi>Luke, The Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the Power of the Higheſt ſhall over ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow thee,</hi> &amp;c. <q>By the Holy Ghoſt (or Spirit) ſays he, and the Power which came from God, we ought to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand nothing but the <hi>Word,</hi> which is the firſt-born of God.</q> And for the better underſtanding what Word he is ſpeaking of, he adds all in one Breath, <q>That 'tis the Spirit which inſpir'd the Prophets, and which ſpake in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a Prophet, or in the Perſon of the Father, or in the Perſon of Chriſt, or in the Perſon of the People.</q> Here's no difficulty; either he has ſaid nothing, or he has formally ſaid, that the Holy Ghoſt which inſpir'd the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and the <hi>Power of the moſt High</hi> of which St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaks, and the <hi>Word</hi> in St. <hi>John,</hi> are all but one and the ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>After a Teſtimony ſo expreſs, I have no need to heap up other Paſſages out of the Writings of this Father, wherein we may in part diſcover the ſame truth: As when, in his Dialogue with <hi>Trypho, P.</hi> 327. he makes an Oppoſition between the <hi>Word of the Serpent</hi> by which <hi>Eve</hi> conceived, and the <hi>Word of God</hi> by which the Bleſſed Virgin did conceive. Theſe are rather flights of Fancy, and ſtarts of Wit in a Preacher, than an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Chriſtian Faith. Only I would have it obſerv'd, how in his <hi>5th</hi> Book, <hi>P.</hi> 284. he collects all the Qualities, and all the Names which were uſually given to the Word, and to the Spirit, that he may apply 'em to Jeſus Chriſt. <q>Firſt, ſays <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> by a neceſſary Emanation, but by his Will by a free Operation: That <hi>Power,</hi> I ſay, which may be called his Word, or his Spirit, according to the different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects wherein one conſiders it.</p>
                  <p>I will produce another Proof of this important Truth from <hi>Theophilus Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chenus,</hi> in his <hi>2d</hi> Book to <hi>Autolycus.</hi> 
                     <q>Who (ſays he, ſpeaking of the Word) being the Spirit of God, the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the Wiſdom, the Power of the Higheſt, came down into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, by whom he ſpake.</q> What could he ſay more formal to make us underſtand that he took for one and the ſame thing, the Spirit of God, his Word, his Wiſdom, and his Power? His mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cannot be miſtaken, when one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders, that the Spirit, and the Word, whereof he ſpeaks, is the ſame that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd the Prophets: Words that very well agree with thoſe of <hi>Juſtin,</hi> which I now come to examine. Theſe two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers underſtood by the <hi>Word,</hi> nothing but that prophetick Spirit, the fulneſs whereof dwelt bodily in Jeſus Chriſt, and that St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>the fulneſs of the Godhead.</hi> This is, in effect, the Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Author of the Homilies aſcrib'd to <hi>Origen,</hi> has given (<hi>in Diverſos Homil.</hi> 2.) <q>St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſays he, calls the fulneſs of the Godhead, thoſe myſtick Senſes (or the truth of thoſe legal Shadows) which dwelt <hi>bodily</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt; that is to ſay, <hi>truly</hi> and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:200403:67"/>
                        <hi>really;</hi> becauſe that he is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Fulneſs of Grace, the truth of the antient Symbols, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of Prophetick Viſions.</q> But, according to the Fathers, Jeſus Chriſt was ſill'd with this Prophetick Spirit, not only when the Holy Spirit deſcended on him in the form of a Dove, and that God made him a Prophet; but eſpecially when he was conceived by the Power of the Higheſt: and he was, as I may ſay, begotten a Prophet, that is to ſay, when by virtue of his Generation his Body was formed for the Office of a Prophet. And 'tis chiefly this laſt Conſideration that is urg'd againſt the <hi>Joſephites,</hi> becauſe this Privilege of his Birth makes us to regard him, not only as a Man who was a Prophet, but as a Prophet who was alſo the Son of God. But to return to the Paſſage from <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus,</hi> if it be read thruout, one ſhall find a fine Allegory upon the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> which he calls the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. Sometimes he conſiders 'em as two Divine Emanations proceeding from the Bowels of God, and which God us'd as his two Hands, or two Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, by whom he created the World: And ſometimes he makes 'em but one Operation, and ſo both are the Spirit and the Word, the Wiſdom and the Power of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Why ſo? If not becauſe that this Spirit takes divers Names, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the diverſity of its <hi>Prolation,</hi> or for its different Operations: For the <hi>Word</hi> is the Spirit (or Breath) prolat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Sound and a Voice, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is a Word brought forth tacitely and in ſilence; the one <hi>with,</hi> the other <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> ſound: One acts <hi>inwardly</hi> in a hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and ſecret manner, and the other <hi>outwardly</hi> and openly. 'Tis thus the Fathers ſpeak. In my opinion, 'tis idle to look for any exactneſs in theſe ſort of allegorical Diſcourſes, which are looſe, and where the Fancy taking its ſwing, drives on in full Career.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Irendus,</hi> one of thoſe Fathers who was obliged to urge the miraculous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of our Saviour againſt the <hi>Epio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> confounded the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> with the <hi>Word.</hi> 
                     <q>Theſe Hereticks would not own, ſays <hi>Ireraeus, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of God with Man.</hi>
                     </q> Why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſays he, they believed the Lord Jeſus to be a mere Man. How a mere Man? Becauſe they believed him to be the Son of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> like other Men, and not of a <hi>Virgin</hi> by the <hi>Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> What ſays the Holy Father to this? He laments that they would not conſider, how in the firſt Creation, <q>the Breath of God uniting it ſelf to the Body of <hi>Adam,</hi> animated the Man, and made him a reaſonable Creature: So in the New Creation, the Word of the Father, and the Spirit of God, being united to the old Subſtance of <hi>Adam,</hi> hath form'd a living and perfect Man, who contains in himſelf the perfect Father.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Bull,</hi> in his <hi>Judic. Eccleſ. p.</hi> 10. having cited this Paſſage, takes no notice of theſe words [<hi>who contains in himſelf the perfect Father</hi>] it may be becauſe <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſeems to ſay, that 'twas the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who was incarnate; or, as 'tis more probable, becauſe theſe Words expreſly demonſtrate, that by the Word, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> underſtood nothing but the very Power of God. The living Man, of whom he ſpeaks, containing in himſelf the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Father, only becauſe he was filled with God's Spirit and God's Word, which were united to the Man. But whatever he himſelf thought, this is a truth that one perceives at firſt in reading the Text of <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> 'Tis at leaſt, moſt evident, that he confounds <hi>the Spirit of God</hi> with <hi>the Word of the Father,</hi> as one and the ſame Power which formed the <hi>New Adam;</hi> and that he oppoſes it to the Divine Breath, and Spirit of God, which animated the firſt <hi>Adam:</hi> His only aim being to oppoſe the <hi>Ebionites,</hi> who denied that the Spirit of God interven'd in the Conception of Jeſus Chriſt. His only concern is alſo to eſtabliſh firmly this miraculous Conception, and to make
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:200403:67"/>'em regard Jeſus Chriſt as the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Man, whom the Father, who is perfect, had miraculouſly begotten by his <hi>Word</hi> and by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> in the ſame manner, as by the means of his Almighty Word he animated the firſt Man with the Breath of Life. To make <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his Conception of the Word the ſame with the Moderns, is to ſee and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. In ſhort, by reading his Text a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, one ſhall be convinced, that in his ſtating the Divinity of Jeſus Chriſt he goes no farther than his miraculous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception by the Holy Ghoſt. He not only confounds the Word with the Spirit, but calls the <hi>Word</hi> the Deſcent of the Holy Spirit into the Womb of <hi>Mary:</hi> He calls it, I ſay, the Union and Mixture of God with Man. He ſays, the Father wrought at the Incarnation of his Son, or at the new Generation, with the ſame Hands (excuſe his Phraſe) as he did at the Generation of the <hi>Old Adam.</hi> If we ask him what he means by <hi>Hands</hi> in this place, he tells you in his <hi>4th</hi> Book, 37 Chap. that he underſtands thereby, the Word of God, his Son, his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and his Spirit: He means, that <hi>powerful Command</hi> which God us'd in the Creation of things, which is called his Spirit, foraſmuch as it is in God, and is in a manner his Soul; and which is alſo call'd his Word and his Son, in regard that it came from his Mouth to form the Creation, it was in a manner <hi>begotten:</hi> That is to ſay, by the ſame manner of ſpeaking, that the Wiſdom and the Power of God are called his <hi>Hands,</hi> by the ſame they are called his Son, his Word, and his Spirit. And further, to make it clearer that this Father always confounds the Holy Ghoſt with the Word, I muſt obſerve, that in the laſt Paſſage I am about to cite, he applies to the Holy Ghoſt the ſame Words of <hi>Solomon,</hi> which are ordinarily applied to the Son. <q>The Word, ſays he, who is the Son, was always with the Father; and becauſe the <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which is the Holy Ghoſt, was alſo with God before the Creation, it ſpeaks thus by <hi>Solomon, God hath founded the Earth by his Wiſdom,</hi> &amp;c. and again, <hi>The Lord created me,</hi> &amp;c.</q> There is therefore but One God, who hath made all things by his Wiſdom, and by his Word.</p>

                  <p>BUT after all, you will ſay, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> makes an expreſs diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Word and the Spirit. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Yes. But <hi>David</hi> makes the ſame diſtinction too, and from him I believe the Fathers borrowed theirs: <hi>The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> ſays he, <hi>were formed by the Word of the Lord, and by the Breath of his Mouth.</hi> By the way, who will be ſo weak as to affirm, that he did not mean by theſe two words the ſame Power of God, as if the Word was not the Breath of his Mouth, and the Breath of his Mouth the Word? Can one forbear ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when one ſees our Divines put <hi>David</hi> in the number of the Trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians? In fine, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> extols the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the son of God by the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Ghoſt, as infinitely more excellent than the Generation of the firſt Man, which was by breathing Life into him, or by the Divine Breath. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> affirms it, but Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> denies it, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that Jeſus Chriſt was not the Son of God by virtue of his miraculous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, in a manner more excellent than <hi>Adam</hi> was by virtue of his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Generation (or Formation) by
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:200403:68"/>God's own hand. Let us ſuppoſe it as the Doctor would have it; yet after all he muſt agree that this Holy Father car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Parallel that he makes between the firſt and ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> no further than their Generation, which was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extraordinary in both. This appears in the <hi>31st</hi> Chapter of his <hi>3d</hi> Book. <q>If the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſays he, had his Being from a Man, it might be ſaid with ſome ſhew of reaſon, that 'tis the ſame as to the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was his Father. But if it be true on the contrary, that the <hi>firſt</hi> was form'd out of the Earth by the <hi>Word</hi> of God; muſt not the ſame Word acting with the ſame Power as he did at the Formation of <hi>Adam,</hi> carry a reſemblance of the ſame Generation?</q> Let this Compariſon be a little minded; it contains this clearly, that God did no more in the Generation of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> in whom he would dwell, than in that of the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> that <hi>Adam</hi> and Jeſus Chriſt are the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Production of this Word: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently there's no more reaſon to infer the hypoſtatick Union of the Word with Jeſus Chriſt, than with <hi>Adam;</hi> this Word being, as you ſee, nothing but the Power of God, which having im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately formed the firſt Man, did alſo form Jeſus Chriſt after the ſame primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive manner of Generation: All the difference is, that God was pleas'd to dwell in the latter after an extraordinary manner.</p>
                  <p>Let's ſee in the next place what <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> has to ſay. He was a great <hi>Platoniſt,</hi> but that Party does not always ſtrictly obſerve the Rules of <hi>Platoniſm:</hi> They have their lucid Intervals, wherein ſome Remains of the antient Tradition drop from their Pens. Whenever they philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phize according to the humour of that Faction, they are to be ſuſpected, 'tis the effect of their Prejudices: but when they happen to ſpeak to the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their own Hypotheſes, what is it that could oblige them to it, but the Power of Truth alone? <hi>Tertullian</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, at the end of his Diſcourſe againſt <hi>Praxeas,</hi> ſiſting this matter of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> to the bottom, ſpeaks of 'em as one and the ſame <hi>Power.</hi> 'Tis worth while to read the whole throughout, but I ſhall content my ſelf with this following Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, which is deciſive, and beyond diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. (<hi>Contra Prax. cap.</hi> 26.) <q>
                        <hi>The Spirit of God</hi> (i. e. <hi>Holy Ghoſi</hi>) <hi>ſhall come upon thee,</hi> &amp;c. By ſaying the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> altho the Spirit of God be God, nevertheleſs he not calling it directly God, he would have us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a Part of the Whole, which was to attend the Perſon of the Son, and get him the Name that he has. This is that Spirit of God, which we call the <hi>Word</hi> alſo: For as when St. <hi>John</hi> ſays, <hi>the Word was made Fleſh,</hi> by the term <hi>[Word]</hi> we underſtand the Spirit; ſo, in this Paſſage we underſtand the <hi>Word</hi> under the Name of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> ſince the <hi>Spirit</hi> is the Subſtance of the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Word</hi> the Operation of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and theſe two are but one: For if the <hi>Spirit</hi> be not the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Word</hi> be not the <hi>Spirit,</hi> 'twill fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that he of whom St. <hi>John</hi> ſays, that <hi>he was made Fleſh,</hi> will not be the ſame with him of whom the Angel ſays, that <hi>he ſhall be made Fleſh.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us weigh well all theſe Words: By the Spirit <hi>Tertullian</hi> underſtands no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>a Portion of the whole,</hi> a Beam of the Subſtance of God, as he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes himſelf elſewhere; becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it would follow, according to <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xeas,</hi> that the Father himſelf was incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. He will have it, that this <hi>Portion</hi> makes the Son what he is, that is, the Son of God: He confounds the Spirit with the Word, and will have St. <hi>Luke</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeak the ſame Language; and that the firſt might have ſaid, <hi>the Word ſhall come upon thee,</hi> and the latter, <hi>the Holy Ghoſt was made Fleſh;</hi> ſince that by the term <hi>[Holy Ghoſt]</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> muſt be underſtood, and by the term <hi>[Word]</hi>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:200403:68"/>the Holy Ghoſt; and that 'tis not likely St. <hi>John</hi> would ſpeak of one particular Spirit, and the Angel of another. And more than this, he acquaints us what uſe we ought to make of theſe two Words, which at the bottom ſignify but the ſame thing; and that is, we ought to call this <hi>Power, Spirit,</hi> when we would expreſs its <hi>Subſtance;</hi> and <hi>Word,</hi> when we would expreſs its <hi>Operation.</hi> In ſhort, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides our Queſtion by ſaying, that theſe <hi>two</hi> are but one and the ſame thing, that is to ſay, the ſame <hi>Power.</hi> 
                     <q>For the Word (ſays he, in his <hi>Rule of Faith, de Praeſcript.</hi>) deſcended from the Spirit, and the Power of God, into the Womb of the Virgin.</q> What does this import, <hi>viz.</hi> the Word deſcended from the Spirit and the Power of God, if not this, that the Word is nothing elſe but an Emanation, a Manifeſtation of the <hi>Power,</hi> which is internal and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to God? And 'tis almoſt in the ſame ſenſe that <hi>Marius Victorin.</hi> (<hi>contra Arium lib.</hi> 1.) ſtates a <hi>twofold Power</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> that is to ſay, a twofold Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>the one manifeſt, which is Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in the Fleſh; the other ſecret (or hidden) which is the Holy Spirit: the one by way of <hi>Manifeſtation,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by way of <hi>Communication.</hi> But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, 'tis but a twofold Operation of one and the <hi>ſame Power.</hi> I forbear to take notice of divers other Teſtimonies of <hi>Tertullian</hi> of the like kind; as for inſtance, at the beginning of his Book concerning <hi>Prayer,</hi> in his Diſpute againſt <hi>Marcion, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 6, &amp; 16. and in his Diſcourſe of the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>cap.</hi> 19. the Reader may conſult 'em, if he pleaſes.</p>
                  <p>To the foremention'd Authoritys from <hi>Tertullian,</hi> I will ſubjoin that of <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> (<hi>de Trinitate cap.</hi> 19.) <q>That which chiefly conſtituted the Son of God, ſays he, was the Incarnation of the <hi>Word</hi> of God, which was formed by means of that Spirit, of whom the Angel ſaid, <hi>the Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee,</hi> &amp;c. For this is the true Son of God, who is of God, who uniting himſelf to the Son of Man, makes him, by that Union, the Son of God, which he was not before: So that the main reaſon of this Title, <hi>the Son of God,</hi> ariſes from that <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Lord which deſcended.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>How, the <hi>Word</hi> of God incarnate by means of that Spirit which deſcended on <hi>Mary!</hi> Is the ſecond Perſon incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate by means of the third? Very good Divinity! Is it not rather this Divine Operation, that bears the Name of the <hi>Word,</hi> which manifeſted it ſelf in the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, by means of the Holy Spirit, which inſinuated it ſelf into that Fleſh? That is to ſay, that which is called the <hi>Spirit</hi> on account of its Subſtance, is at the ſame time called the <hi>Word</hi> on account of its Manifeſtation, and its Operation. For this reaſon <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatian</hi> places not the chief ground of the <hi>Filiation</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, in <hi>a Word,</hi> which was a different Hypoſtaſis from the Spirit; but in <hi>the Word,</hi> which is the <hi>Operation</hi> of that <hi>Spirit,</hi> of whom the Scripture ſpeaks, ſaying, <hi>the Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee,</hi> &amp;c. And it would not be underſtood what the Fathers mean, when they confound the <hi>Word</hi> with the <hi>Spirit</hi> that over-ſhadowed the Virgin, or when they diſtinguiſh theſe two Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; if it be not laid down for a Rule, that by the <hi>Spirit</hi> they underſtand the very Nature of the Spirit, the Principle (or Source) whence Prophecy comes; and by the <hi>Word,</hi> a certain and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Operation</hi> of that <hi>Spirit;</hi> as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the miraculous Conception of our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>I have yet an antient Doctor to alledg, and he not of the meaneſt Rank; I mean St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who does not make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſtinction between the <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Son of God,</hi> the <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> &amp;c. This Father having cited the ſecond Pſalm (<hi>de Mont. Sina &amp; Zion, adv. Jud. cap.</hi> 2.) where he ſpeaks of the King whom God had anointed on Mount <hi>Sion;</hi> 
                     <q>'Tis upon this Mountain (ſays he)
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:200403:69"/>that the <hi>Holy Spirit, the Son of God,</hi> was eſtabliſh'd King, to proclaim the Will and the Empire of <hi>God</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and in the fourth Chapter of the ſame Diſcourſe, the Fleſh of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> ſays he, which J. C. bore <hi>in a Figure</hi> (that Term has a Tang of <hi>Marcion</hi>'s Hereſy) this Fleſh was call'd by his Father <hi>the Holy Spirit,</hi> which came down from Heaven, the Chriſt, the anointed of the Living God, a Spirit united to Fleſh.</q> The ſame Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther elſewhere (<hi>in his Diſcourſe de Idolor. vanit. cap.</hi> 6.) expreſſes himſelf thus: <q>The Word and the Son of God is ſent, whom the Prophets had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoken of as the Inſtructor of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. He is the Power of God, his Reaſon, his Wiſdom, and his Glory; the Holy Spirit hath put on Fleſh, God is mingled or united with Man.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Holy Spirit is the Son of God, and at the ſame time the Word is the Son of God; and which is more, the Fleſh of J.C. is called the Holy Spirit which came down from Heaven; which could not be true but of its Celeſtial Origin, and as it was formed by the Holy Spirit. So that <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſeems to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate thereby, that 'tis becauſe of this Celeſtial Origin, that the Scriptures ſay, the Fleſh of J. C. came down from Heaven, that the Son of Man came down from Heaven; for it may be very well ſaid, that J.C. came down from Heaven, ſince his Origin was from Heaven in his Birth by the Holy Ghoſt. And what is the [Holy Spirit] but the <hi>Word,</hi> according to this Father? The Word is the Holy Spirit, which united it ſelf to Man, the Word is the Holy Spirit which put on Fleſh: In ſhort, 'tis the Holy Spirit which is the Chriſt of God. You'll ſay what hinders, but the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity may have alſo the Name of the third? That's pure Fancy! Why ſhould one ſhut ones eyes, when one ſees as clear as the day, that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> alludes to the miraculous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of our Saviour, and that theſe ſublime Expreſſions of that Father have no other Foundation but that Myſtery?</p>
                  <p>As for what <hi>Lactantius</hi> affords us, I hope his Authority will not be conteſted with me in the deciſion of a Point, wherein he does no more than confirm a Tradition, elſewhere well ſupported and followed. This pious Perſon having ſaid in his Inſtitutions, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>That God begat a Holy Spirit,</hi> which he call'd his Son, he reſumes this Diſcourſe in the <hi>12th chap.</hi> of the ſame Book, thus: <q>This Spirit of God, ſays he, coming down from Heaven, made choice of a pure and holy Virgin, into whoſe Womb he inſinuated himſelf; and this Virgin conceived, being full of the Holy Spirit which embrac'd her.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which <hi>Lactantius</hi> expreſſes by theſe Words, <hi>deſcended on a Virgin,</hi> can it be any other than that which St. <hi>Luke</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes in theſe, <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee?</hi> But the Holy Ghoſt, of whom the Angel ſpeaks, is the ſame, according to <hi>Lactantius,</hi> with that Holy Ghoſt which God begat, and which he called his Son. Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> tells us, the Fathers underſtood by the Holy Ghoſt, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature of J. C. Very well! but why ſo? If not for this Cauſe, that J. C. had no other Divinity than that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Power and Holineſs, which form'd his Body in the Womb of a Virgin. For in ſhort, the Fathers ſpeak after this manner, when they explain theſe words, <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee,</hi> &amp;c. or allude to them, and always with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his Birth of a Virgin. But the Holy Spirit in <hi>this Paſſage, Luke</hi> 1. 35. ſignifies moſt certainly that Power, which we <hi>Trinitarians</hi> call the third Perſon. And if the Fathers had a mind to find the ſecond there, as is ſaid, there's no knowing what the Words ſignify; for it muſt be affirmed, that they have ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtaken the Scriptures, and in ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable manner, as I may ſay, that there is no longer any certainty to be met with in their Writin<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:200403:69"/>There's nothing whereby to diſcover the Names of the Divine Perſons, nor by conſequence the Perſons themſelves. Be it as it will, the Doctor will find it hard enough to apply his Solution to all the Arguments I am about to mention. And if he can do it, 'twill be no more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for him to find the Divinity of J. C. in all the Paſſages of the Goſpel, where mention is made of the Holy Ghoſt. I hope alſo that at laſt he'l ſay, that when J. C. promis'd his Holy Spirit to his Apoſtles, he promis'd them his Divine Nature.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt beg my Reader's Patience a little longer, to ſee what Anſwer the Doctor will make againſt the laſt Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity I am going to alledg. And that's a Letter of the Council of <hi>Sardis,</hi> in the ſecond Book of <hi>Theodoret</hi>'s <hi>Hiſt. Eccleſ.</hi> The Fathers there drew a Creed in three very diſtinct Articles, the firſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Father, the ſecond the Son, and third Article the Holy Ghoſt. In the laſt, which is ſo expreſly diſtinguiſhed from that of the Son, they ſpeak thus of the Incarnation by the Holy Ghoſt: <q>We believe alſo there is a Holy Spirit or Paraclet, which the Lord promis'd and ſent. He did not ſuffer; but the Man whom he aſſumed or took from the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> he ſuffer'd, becauſe he was capable of it; whereas God is immortal, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, which is a Neuter. Now of this Spirit the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſay he cannot ſuffer; but 'twas Man, whom he put on and took from the Virgin, that did ſuffer. This they ſpeak, I ſay, of the Paraclet, whom they confeſs after the Father and the Son, and not of the Divine Nature of J. C. A Paſſage expreſs and formal, which clearly proves theſe Doctors underſtood nothing elſe by the Holy Ghoſt, but that Power of God, whereof the <hi>Word</hi> is the <hi>Manifeſtation</hi> and the <hi>Operation,</hi> confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit with the Word, and very diſtinctly aſſuring us, that <hi>the Paraclet was incarnate.</hi> Is the Paraclet the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature of J. C. or the ſecond Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Trinity? Here we'll wait the Doctor's Anſwer. <hi>Valeſius</hi> not bearing with this Incongruity in the Council, had the Boldneſs to corrupt this Paſſage in his Verſion, by foiſting in the word [Chriſt] for thus he has tranſlated it: <q>He did not ſuffer, but the Man whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> put on.</q> The Word [Chriſt] is not in the Text, which intirely relates to the Holy Ghoſt or Paraclet: In ſhort, that Word ruines the whole ſenſe of the Period, and ſtrangely confounds all this third Article, which belongs only to the Holy Ghoſt, and is diſtinct from that concerning J. C. Both Tranſlators and Copiſts are guilty of Falſification in this particular.</p>
                  <p>Give me leave to affirm one thing, and that is, that the Antients have often diſtinguiſhed <hi>the Holy Spirit</hi> from <hi>the Power of the Higheſt,</hi> whereof he is ſpeaking in the ſame Text, calling the latter the <hi>Word of God,</hi> the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and ſaying only of the former, that he overſhadowed the Virgin. Now even this ſhews, that by the Word, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood nothing but the Power and the Operation of the Holy Spirit, which is the ſame thing with the Power and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Higheſt. The <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> ſignifying the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> of the Higheſt ſignifying the <hi>Operation;</hi> it follows, that the <hi>Word,</hi> which is the Power of the Higheſt, according to the Fathers, is not otherwiſe diſtinguiſhed from the [Holy Spirit] than as the <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> is diſtinguiſhed from its Subject.</p>
                  <p>We may conclude therefore from Proofs ſo very evident, that the Antients who have deified J. C. had no other ground for their Theology, <hi>but the Birth of J. C. of a Virgin by the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> that by the <hi>Word</hi> and the <hi>Son of God,</hi> they always underſtood <hi>this miraculous Operation;</hi> and that they never advanced any higher <hi>(in their Diſcourſes)</hi> towards that, which is called <hi>an eternal Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> An Account of the Foundation of the Allegorical Theology of the Fathers, concerning the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>the Holy Spirit.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>I Dare aſſure my Reader, that I can ſhew him the very Foundation of this Allegorical Theology. 'Tis known that the Fathers imitated the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> in many things, and particularly in the way of <hi>Allegory</hi> and <hi>Contemplation.</hi> But 'twas <hi>Mark</hi> the <hi>Valentinian,</hi> as we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by <hi>Irenaeus, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. who was the Author of the Allegorical Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition on the <hi>Birth of J. C.</hi> that is, the firſt who elevated it to a ſenſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and Myſtery. He makes a <hi>Quaternity</hi> of the <hi>Man</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> which are the firſt Pair; and of the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> which are the ſecond Pair. But what ſort of Theology does he couch under this Enigma or Allegory? Why nothing leſs than the wonderful Conception of J. C. <q>
                        <hi>The Man,</hi> ſays he, is <hi>the Power of the Higheſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that acted inſtead of the Man. The <hi>Church</hi> is the <hi>Holy Virgin,</hi> becauſe ſhe held the place of the Church. The <hi>Angel Gabriel</hi> was inſtead of the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> inſtead of <hi>Life.</hi>
                     </q> Nothing can better convince us of the <hi>Allegory</hi> us'd by the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> than this Paſſage, in which the <hi>Angel</hi> is the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> is the <hi>Life;</hi> the <hi>Power of the Higheſt</hi> is inſtead of the <hi>Man,</hi> and the Virgin is inſtead of the Church. I might alſo have produc'd this Paſſage for a Proof, when I was arguing this Point; but I have reſerv'd it on purpoſe for this place, to ſhew that the whole Myſtery of the <hi>Word</hi> reduces it ſelf to the miraculous Conception of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> upon which both the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and the Orthodox have equally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorized, each taking his Flight as his Contemplation led him on: And this is that famous Theology ſo much extolled by the Fathers.</p>
                  <p>I know moſt of them, being entangled with their <hi>Platoniſm,</hi> have mightily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiled the firſt and antient Ideas of this matter. But I know alſo, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came to make <hi>two Hypoſtaſes</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> and the Holy Spirit, they were terribly perplexed about the latter, and could not tell what to do. Hence it was, without doubt, that they ſo long delayed the deifying [of the Holy Ghoſt] The Council of <hi>Nice</hi> has not at all touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon its Divinity. So far were they from it, and the Holy Ghoſt made ſo ſmall a Figure at that time, <hi>that ſome Fathers of the Council made no difficulty to give its place to the Bleſſed Virgin, by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her the third Perſon in the Trinity.</hi> Of which we are informed by <hi>Elmacinus</hi> and <hi>Patricides,</hi> in <hi>Hotting. Orient. Hiſt. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 227. The Council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> durſt not ſpeak openly upon the point: And in S. <hi>Baſil</hi>'s time, there was a little Shineſs in calling the Holy Ghoſt directly and formally <hi>God.</hi> 'Tis worth our regard what <hi>Petavius, de Trinit. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7. §. 2. ſays hereupon: <q>The Catholic Church, ſays he, accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating it ſelf, for prudential Reaſons, to human Frailty, came not to the <hi>full</hi> Profeſſion of <hi>ſome</hi> Points, but by little and little, and by degrees. For it did not define nor pronounce any thing in expreſs Terms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Deity</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, during the four firſt Ages very near. 'Tis certain <hi>Gregory Naz. Orat.</hi> 20. &amp; <hi>Ep.</hi> 26. excuſes the Conduct of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> who, tho he was right in his Opinion of the Deity of the Holy
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:200403:70"/>Ghoſt, would not however for Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, call it <hi>God</hi> openly and expreſly, becauſe he knew there were many, otherwiſe good Catholicks, who would be offended if that Name ſhould be given to the Holy Ghoſt, that being not ordinarily and publickly done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Catholicks till after the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond General Council, held in 381.</q> Which is as much as to ſay, that at laſt, Time and Cuſtom had placed the Holy Ghoſt in the Number of the Gods.</p>
                  <p>Good God! almoſt four intire Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Church, which were the brighteſt and the pureſt, did determine nothing about the Deity of the Holy Ghoſt: juſt before the end of the 4th, they durſt not ſpeak of it but ſhily, for fear of offending the very Orthodox themſelves. Where was then the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Was the Tradition then loſt? What, that of the Orthodox and the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, who rejected or at leaſt were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at an Article ſo fundamental! What greater Crime could Hereticks have been guilty of? Whence came it that the third Perſon was admitted ſo very late? Prudence, they tell us, would have the Notion conceal'd for a time. But why was not that of the ſecond Perſon concealed too? Are there not the ſame prudential Reaſons for that too? I think I perceive the difference of the caſe. The third was not known to the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing Fathers</hi> themſelves, but in a very confuſed manner, and was not by the greateſt part of them held for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a Creature. The <hi>Second</hi> was in high eſteem with all the <hi>Platonic</hi> Party, deifyed by the whole Sect, the Favourite Notion, and principal Machine of the Syſtem. 'Twas eaſy to introduce this among the Gods of their Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which at that time was modell'd according to <hi>Plato</hi>'s Notions. But for the third, which was not ſo much in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, 'twas difficult to admit it into that <hi>Rank,</hi> without great Addreſs and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution. In the mean time, their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautiouſneſs has prov'd a Diſadvantage to both; the third interferes with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, who ſhould have been <hi>produced</hi> at the ſame time with his Brother, or both eternally concealed: For it the third cannot defend it ſelf, what will become of the ſecond, which is his elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? He is not of better Blood, nor of a nobler Stock.</p>
                  <p>Can we doubt, after ſuch convincing Proofs of the antient Tradition, but by <hi>the Virgin Church</hi> (whereof <hi>Hegeſippus</hi> ſpeaks, in <hi>Euſeb. Hiſt. Eccleſ. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 32.) this <hi>antient Nazarene</hi> meant the Church of the Circumciſion, which had not yet imbibed <hi>Platoniſm;</hi> as by <hi>the Seduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Error,</hi> and <hi>Science falſly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> that had its Birth under <hi>Adrian</hi>'s Reign, he meant the <hi>Platonizing Doctrine of the Gnoſtics,</hi> which was then brought into the Church? 'Twas Philoſophy that intirely ruin'd the true Religion, as the Apoſtles had foretold. In ſhort, <hi>Valeſius</hi> obſerves upon the Paſſage I ſhall by and by cite out of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> that this Hiſtorian too much extends the words of <hi>Hegeſippus,</hi> aſcribing thro Miſtake to the Univerſal Church, what <hi>Hegeſippus</hi> ſpoke only of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> or <hi>Judea.</hi> But <hi>Hegeſippus</hi> his being ſo particular is remarkable. He would have us <hi>obſerve</hi> by it, that fatal Epocha, when the <hi>Nazarene Chriſtian Biſhops</hi> were ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and by that means <hi>Platoniſm</hi> came in the room of that pure and unmixt Truth, which St. <hi>James</hi> his Succeſſors had preached, which happened exactly in the Reign of <hi>Adrian,</hi> that is, when the <hi>Jews</hi> were driven out of <hi>Judea,</hi> and the Chriſtians of the Circumciſion with them. <hi>Sulpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Severus</hi> in his <hi>Hiſt. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 45. had reaſon to ſay; the Chriſtian Faith (which according to him is the <hi>Platoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Doctrine</hi>) drew great advantages from this Diſperſion. He would have ſaid, that the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> then ceaſing the Obſervation of the legal Ceremonies, made no further ſcruple to unite with the <hi>Gentile</hi> Church. But this is not all, the greateſt advantage that accrued to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:200403:71"/>the <hi>Gentile</hi> Church, was, that <hi>Platoniſm</hi> meeting no longer with any Oppoſition from the Primitive Faith, which the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> had inviolably preſerv'd, it ſpread far and wide, and like an Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion overſpread the whole Church, not excepting that of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that antient Repoſitory of the Apoſtolick Tradition, which then loſt its Simplicity and Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as <hi>Hegeſippus</hi> expreſſes it. 'Twas at this time the Gentiles in the Perſon of Pope <hi>Victor,</hi> roſe up againſt the Chriſtians of the Circumciſion, and oppreſs'd 'em, by taking from 'em an Apoſtolick Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion touching the Day when the Paſſover was to be celebrated. And if they could wreſt from 'em this Tradition in a point of mere Practice, it was more eaſy to ſtrip 'em of a Tradition in a point of Doctrine, concerning the Nature and Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, the former being much more eaſily retained than the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. There muſt have been a great noiſe and hurly-burly to alter the former; whereas for the latter, 'twas enough if they took the method of explaining and illuſtrating, or pretended an accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a Senſe more noble and profound. 'Tis of this Innovation, attended with Tyranny, that the <hi>Artemonites</hi> complain, as <hi>Euſeb.</hi> tells us, <hi>Hiſt. Eccleſ. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 28. Their Complaint was, that their Doctrine, which was the ſame Truth that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients and Apoſtles had taught, and which had been preſerved intire till the time of Pope <hi>Victor,</hi> was corrupted under <hi>Zephirin</hi> his Succeſſor. The <hi>Anonymous,</hi> who relates this, endeavours to confute 'em, by alledging Authors who liv'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Victor,</hi> and had aſcrib'd Divinity to Jeſus Chriſt, or had called him God: But I have demonſtrated that this Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of the Antients is grounded only upon the <hi>Birth of our Saviour of a Virgin by the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and does by no means go ſo far as the <hi>Platonick Notion</hi> of his Generation. The firſt of theſe the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temonites</hi> did not diſown, for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd Jeſus Chriſt to be the Son of God by <hi>Mary.</hi> If the <hi>Anonymous</hi> would prove from the Antients againſt the <hi>Artemonites,</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt was God's Son begotten before all Ages, how comes it to paſs, that he finds no antienter a Patron of his <hi>Platonizing</hi> Opinion, than <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> who wrote after the fatal <hi>Epicha,</hi> when the Succeſſion of the <hi>Nazarene</hi> Biſhops ended, and after the riſe of the firſt <hi>Gnoſticiſm, Baſilides</hi> and <hi>Valentinus,</hi> &amp;c. that is, after the Church had loſt its Virgin Purity, and the <hi>Gnoſtick</hi> Opinions had corrupted the antient Theology?</p>
                  <p>The Authorities of his date are to be ſuſpected. Why does he not aſcend as high as <hi>Barnabas, Hermas, Clemens Romanus,</hi> and <hi>Polycarp?</hi> Would he have wanted the Honour of having theſe <hi>Apoſtolick Men</hi> for his <hi>Vouchers,</hi> if he had thought 'em oppoſite to <hi>Artemon?</hi> He does not go ſo far back as <hi>Ignatius;</hi> which makes it to be ſuſpected, either that he did not believe <hi>Ignatius</hi> favour'd the Opinion of Chriſt's Pre-exiſtence, or that the Epiſtles of that Father were a Forgery after his time. 'Tis to the firſt and earlieſt Antiquity we muſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend: <hi>Artemon</hi> will be in the right, if he rejects thoſe latter Teſtimonies, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces more antient ones for his own Doctrine. But the <hi>Anonymous</hi> cites Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo does <hi>Artemon</hi> appeal to it, alledging that his Doctrine is the ſame Truth that the Apoſtles had taught: That therefore is the thing in queſtion. We ſhall ſee hereafter who has the moſt reaſon to appeal to this moſt Primitive Authority; for I intend to examine in what ſenſe the Son of God is there deify'd.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Anonymous</hi> makes another ſmall attack upon the <hi>Artemonites,</hi> for their ſeeming to inſinuate, that <hi>Victor</hi> was not againſt their Doctrine, but that <hi>Zephirin</hi> was the firſt that did perſecute it. I will not repeat here what I have remark'd touching the depoſing of <hi>Theodotus,</hi> that <hi>Victor</hi> might excommunicate <hi>him</hi> as an <hi>Ebionite,</hi> without breaking Communion with the <hi>Artemonites,</hi> who maintained the Orthodox Doctrine of the miraculous
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:200403:71"/>Conception of our Saviour. 'Tis ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient at preſent to ſhew, that the Words of <hi>Artemon</hi> may fairly ſignify, that <hi>Victor</hi> was the firſt who attack'd the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick Faith, but that <hi>Zephirin</hi> intirely deſtroy'd it. So far is <hi>Artemon</hi> from rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Victor</hi> among thoſe who preſerv'd the Truth intire, that he ſeems to ſay on the contrary, that he began, and <hi>Zephirin</hi> completed its Ruin. <hi>Victor</hi> began, by excommunicating one ſingle Chriſtian, <hi>Theodotus;</hi> and certainly <hi>Zephirin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by excommunicating the whole Orthodox Church, or all the other Great Men who joined with <hi>Artemon</hi> in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>expiring Truth;</hi> as the <hi>Fable</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Bp <hi>Natalis,</hi> that comes after, inclines one to think. I call it a <hi>Fable,</hi> for nothing is more extravagant, than to talk of Angels whipping and ſcourging the <hi>Artemonite</hi> Biſhop into the boſom of the Church. How! were the Angels the firſt who made Converts by <hi>Dragooning?</hi> Is there any thing that can more diſcredit this Romance of the <hi>Anonymous?</hi> Another Story, that <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> has tack'd to this, is, when he makes the <hi>Anonymous</hi> ſay, that <hi>Theodotus</hi> was the firſt Author of the <hi>Error</hi> aſcrib'd to him, which is falſe, take his Hereſy in what ſenſe you pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> endeavours to cover the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of <hi>Euſebius</hi> by a certain wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched diſtinction; but he does not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that <hi>Euſebius</hi> contradicts him, for he goes on to ſay in the ſame Book, that <hi>Theodotus</hi> was the firſt whom <hi>Victor</hi> excommunicated; which ſuppoſes that he was the firſt who ſuffer'd for his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to this Doctrine, but not the firſt who publiſhed it. If he was the firſt Martyr for it, it does not follow that he was the firſt Author of it. 'Tis highly probable, that the great noiſe of the Excommunication of <hi>Theodotus,</hi> upon the very account that this Perſecution was new and unheard of, made him paſs in after-times for the very Author of that Opinion for which he was perſecuted. Not to inſiſt on it at preſent, that <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> makes no ſcruple a little to corrupt the Story at all times, when he can by that Fraud give the Air of Antiquity to his <hi>Platonick Logos,</hi> or of Novelty to the oppoſite Doctrine, which he hated with all his heart; he has been catcht in ſo many other Places, that the Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt him cannot but be very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. For inſtance, where he makes <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> ſay, that on the Day of Chriſt's Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, a Voice was heard in the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Let us go hence.</hi> And witneſs another Paſſage, where he makes the ſame <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſay (<hi>Euſeb. Hiſt. Eccl. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 9.) that 'twas an Angel who appear'd over the Head of <hi>Herod Agrippa;</hi> whereas <hi>Joſephus</hi> expreſſy ſays, it was an <hi>Owl.</hi> One plainly diſcerns where the pious Fraud lies; he would not have it be thought that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Hiſtorian did not agree with St. <hi>Luke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus it appears, in ſpite of all the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> that 'twas in the time of <hi>Victor</hi> and <hi>Zephirin</hi> that the pure Faith of the firſt Chriſtians fell with the Church of the <hi>Nazarens,</hi> which from that time have often paſs'd for <hi>Hereticks.</hi> The new Succeſſion of <hi>Gentile</hi> Biſhops (<hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeb. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 5.) began with one <hi>Mark,</hi> and <hi>Platoniſm</hi> enter'd into the Church with the new Biſhops. <hi>Saturninus, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilides,</hi> and the whole Claſs of the <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,</hi> made a mighty progreſs after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, under colour of diſcovering Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets unknown heretofore to the Church. About the ſame time <hi>Carpocrates</hi> his Hereſy was broach'd, another <hi>Myſtery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> To ſpeak the truth, the infamous Practices of theſe Pretenders to Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation were not long born withal in the Church: Human Nature alone, without the Succours of Religion, knew how to quit it ſelf of it in a ſhort time. But as for their Philoſophy, the Church ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged that to her purpoſe: after ſome ſifting and refining, 'twas adjuſted to the more ſpecious part of her Religion, for the ſupport of her new Opinions; which being pure Speculations, the Affections were not ſo far concern'd about 'em, as
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:200403:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>to take notice of their <hi>Repugnancy:</hi> And the Mind, which is naturally deſirous of Knowledg, found its account in 'em; and the natural Veneration Men have for Myſtery, and for every thing they do not comprehend, had the greateſt Stroke in this matter, and gained the Point. So one ſees how by inſenſible Methods and Degrees, the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which is a <hi>Doctrine purely practical,</hi> was exchanged for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, Myſtery</hi> and <hi>Fanaticiſm.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> An Account of the firſt Christians, call'd <hi>Nazarens.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>TO conclude, it may not be amiſs to give my Readers an Idea of the firſt Chriſtians, called <hi>Nazarens.</hi> There were two ſorts of 'em, as many of the Fathers, and ſome of the Moderns have obſerv'd: The former improperly ſo called, and more properly <hi>Ebionites;</hi> for they believ'd Jeſus Chriſt to have been the Son of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and obliged the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> to keep the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Among theſe, ſuch who held <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be <hi>the Chriſt,</hi> were tolerated, and accounted <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> but the others had not that Character, becauſe they made <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law neceſſary to Salvation, and held Jeſus for no more than a juſt Man, or a Prophet, who ſuffer'd in the Cauſe of Righteouſneſs and Truth: They would not have the Benefits of his Miſſion to extend to the Gentiles; or in a word, that he was the <hi>promis'd Meſſiah,</hi> and had any Power in Heaven. Some believed he was not truly rais'd from the Dead; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers believed he was, that he might receive the Reward of a Good Man, but not that he might be made Lord of the World: They could not be perſuaded to think that Jeſus, who was come in the Fleſh, that is, in ſo low and mean a Condition, could be <hi>the glorious Meſſiah, the Chriſt</hi> ſo often promis'd by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
                  <p>The other ſort of <hi>Nazarens,</hi> properly ſo called, were the Believers of <hi>Judea,</hi> to whom that Name was given, as the Name <hi>[Chriſtian]</hi> was to the Gentile Proſelytes. Theſe believ'd Jeſus Chriſt to be born of a Virgin by the Holy Ghoſt, and in this Senſe they called him the <hi>Son of God:</hi> and not only ſo, but they confeſs'd this Son of God to be <hi>the Chriſt.</hi> For 'tis thus the Words of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> muſt be underſtood (<hi>de Haereſ. c.</hi> 9.) and not as Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> expounds 'em (<hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic. Eccleſ. p.</hi> 47.) by a <hi>Hyſteron Proteron,</hi> in this manner, that <hi>the Chriſt was the Son of God,</hi> that is, according to him, a Son begotten before all Ages. <hi>Danaus,</hi> a better Critick than he, made no blunder in his Expoſition of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Words: <hi>The</hi> Nazarens, ſays he, <hi>believ'd that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the Son of</hi> Mary, <hi>was the Chriſt;</hi> and 'tis certain the Words ought to be taken in this Senſe. (<hi>Dei filium conſiten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Nazaraei eſſe Chriſtum,</hi> ſays the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.) In ſhort, they did not oblige the Gentiles to obſerve the Law, which they thought themſelves ought to keep, as being <hi>Jews</hi> by birth; but they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward abandon'd it too, as an Obligation that ceas'd as ſoon as they were driven out of <hi>Judea</hi> by the Emperor <hi>Adrian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a great confuſion among Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Writers, in their Judgment of theſe <hi>Nazarens.</hi> Some look upon 'em as Hereticks, with others they paſs for <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox.</hi> The latter Fathers, as <hi>Epiphae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> place 'em in their Liſts of Hereticks; but the more antient Fathers, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> have not ſet 'em down in that Catalogue. 'Tis eaſy to conjecture
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:200403:72"/>whence this Diſagreement comes. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they paſs'd for <hi>Orthodox, 1ſt.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Opinion that Jeſus Chriſt was born of a Virgin by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being originally the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Faith, ſome Remains of that Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion maintain'd their Honour for a time. <hi>2ly.</hi> Becauſe <hi>Euſebius,</hi> after <hi>Hegeſippus,</hi> had given 'em this Teſtimony, <hi>that their Faith was ſound,</hi> as we have before ſhewn. Now this Hiſtorian, who gave his Opinion of 'em according to his own Prejudices, miſtaking their true Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, has drawn other <hi>Platonizing</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians after him into the ſame Miſtake. <hi>3ly.</hi> The <hi>Nazarens</hi> believ'd that by virtue of the miraculous Conception of our Saviour, God was truly his Father; and for this reaſon they give him the Title of the Son of God, and it may be, of <hi>God</hi> too ſometimes. The <hi>Platonizing</hi> Chriſtians ſuffered themſelves to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſed with big Words, having their Minds pre-ingaged in Ideas they had put upon 'em beforehand; ſo that they were ſo far from treating the <hi>Nazarens</hi> as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi> that they have often made 'em ſpeak in the <hi>Platonick</hi> manner, always ſuppoſing thro prejudice, that whoever ſaid theſe Words <hi>[Son of God]</hi> meant by 'em, a Son begotten before all Ages. But ſometimes alſo they reckened 'em <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> either becauſe they confounded 'em with the <hi>Ebionites,</hi> or becauſe their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, rightly underſtood, was look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as Heretical, after <hi>Platoniſm</hi> prevail'd. When all thoſe, in ſhort, who went for the Divinity of Chriſt no farther than <hi>his Generation from God and the Virgin Mary,</hi> and who refus'd to ſubſcribe or aſſent to <hi>the Platonick Generation before all Ages;</hi> all ſuch, I ſay, were no better treated than the <hi>Ebionites,</hi> who believed <hi>Chriſt to be the Son of</hi> Joſeph; they were all anathematiz'd without hopes of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. 'Tis from this confuſion of Ideas, that we meet with ſo much obſcurity in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Nazarens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Bull,</hi> who knew not how to clear up this Perplexity, runs himſelf into greater Difficulties: He teazes and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues himſelf to maintain his own Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments under the Expreſſions of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarens,</hi> and to reconcile the irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable Cenſures of the <hi>Platonizing</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers about 'em. But what ſignifies all this ado? The truth is, nothing of his <hi>Platoniſm</hi> was in the leaſt known to the <hi>Nazarens.</hi> All his Citations are ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the equivocal Senſe of theſe Words <hi>[the Son of God.]</hi> True it is, they went beyond the <hi>Ebionites,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd Jeſus Chriſt was more than a mere Man, becauſe they believ'd him <hi>to be born of a Virgin by the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> Yet the <hi>Nazarens</hi> muſt be Hereticks, ſay the Doctor what he will, if they are to be try'd by his <hi>Platonick Faith:</hi> But they are alſo Orthodox, ſay others what they pleaſe, if they are examin'd by the Rule of Orthodoxy that prevail'd in the firſt Age of the Church, the Footſteps whereof have been preſerv'd by ſome Writers in ſucceeding Ages, as I have already proved.</p>
